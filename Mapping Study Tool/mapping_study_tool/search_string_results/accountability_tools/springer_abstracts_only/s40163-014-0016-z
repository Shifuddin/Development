                            <p class="Para">NGT is a highly structured technique combining characteristics of an individual survey and a focus group.</p>
                            <p class="Para">It offers various benefits: 1) it limits researcher influence and influence from group dynamics; 2) increases the likelihood of equal participation for all group members; 3) affords equal influence to (conflicting) values and ideas; 4) can be used in an exploratory (phase of a) study as well as to generate hypotheses about topics that are unfamiliar to the researcher; and 5) is useful for determining the ideas of a research population that is socially or culturally different from that of the researcher.</p>
                            <p class="Para">NGT is particularly relevant in applied research as a decision-making tool and as a consensus method. It also holds promise as an online tool for criminological research focused on sensitive topics where participants take part anonymously.</p>
