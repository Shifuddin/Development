                          <p class="Para">Numerous projects in the area of Real-World Internet (RWI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Internet Connected Objects have proposed architectures for the systems they develop. All of these systems are faced with very similar problems in their architecture and design and interoperability among these systems is limited. To address these issues and to speed up development and deployment while at the same time reduce development and maintenance costs, reference architectures are an appropriate tool. As reference architectures require agreement among all stakeholders, they are usually developed in an incremental process. This paper presents the current status of our work on a reference architecture for the RWI as an architectural blueprint.</p>
