                          <p class="Para">Security is one of the critical aspects of current systems, which are based on loosely coupled and technology-agnostic service-oriented architectures (SOA). Though SOA is the driving force for enterprises to open their ends for global business collaborations, nevertheless it evolves many challenges for modeling and enforcing security. One of the main problems for designing secure systems is the lack of consistent frameworks and methodologies for modeling security concerns. Traditional approaches consider security at the end of system development, which evolves inflexible and un-configurable systems, which are too difficult to maintain and manage. The other major problem with current approaches is that they assume pre-defined and hard-coded security patterns and mechanisms for secure system design. Whereas, the evolving SOA systems require configurable security to realize different security patterns and security policies in a variety of business scenarios. To solve these problems, it is necessary to model security concerns from the beginning of system modeling in a platform-independent way. This paper proposes a pattern refinement approach for security modeling to achieve configurable and declarative security, based on the principles of abstraction, refinement, separation-of-concerns and maintainability to achieve flexible configurations of SOA security. In the proposed approach, a Domain Expert defines abstract policies using common security vocabulary and a Security Expert models security with patterns and refines them for a target architecture in successive systematic refinements. Furthermore, it facilitates the transformation of abstract security models into executable security policies for the target platforms.</p>
