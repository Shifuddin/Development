                          <p class="Para">This paper will investigate the fundamental issues related to building and composing secure components. While all participants will closely cooperate, each will have primary responsibility in one area. The approach outlined in this paper develops a certification process for testing software components for security proper- ties. The anticipated results from this paper are a process, set of core white-box and black-box testing technologies to certify the security of software components and a framework for constructing compositional Component Security Assurance (CSA) based on the security property exposed by the atomic components. The manifestation of the product is a stamp of approval in the form of a digital signature.</p>
