                          <p class="Para">Although ubiquitous technologies such as RFID, sensor networks, and networked embedded systems are quite mature, widespread adoption by organizations has yet to take place. This may be due to the lack of systematic assessment of the potential of ubiquitous technologies for creating value. Accordingly, a prescriptive model is presented that shows how value is created through the fit between generic capabilities of ubiquitous technologies and task characteristics in business processes. The identified task characteristics can thus be used as indicators for assessing the potential improvements in business process performance through particular ubiquitous computing functionalities.</p>
