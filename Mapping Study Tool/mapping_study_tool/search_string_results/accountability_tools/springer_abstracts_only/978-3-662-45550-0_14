                          <p class="Para">Companies are taking more and more advantage of cloud architectures for their IT systems. By combining private and public cloud resources, it is possible to facilitate data submissions by customers and processing with third parties, among other advantages. But this represents also a potential threat to personal dataâ€™s privacy and confidentiality. Even if legal obligations regulate the usage of personal data, for example requiring to disclose them in anonymised form, users do not have any visibility or control on data disclosure operations, nor on anonmymisation policies used by companies. To this extent, we propose a solution to establish and enforce data-centric security policies, in order to enable secure and compliant data processing operations. Our proposal is particularly fit for cloud architectures as it supports multiple actors with different roles, responsibilities and obligations. We also present a use case to demonstrate the peculiarities of our proposition.</p>
