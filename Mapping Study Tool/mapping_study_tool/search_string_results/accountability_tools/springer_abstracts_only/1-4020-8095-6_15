                          <p class="Para">This paper considers the proposition that actor-network theory (ANT)might be adopted within a broader critical paradigm to conduct empirical studies. The paper outlines the main tenets of the two theories, with the critical perspective primarily represented by Foucault.The aim is not to provide an extensive discussion of critical theory and ANT but to focus on their approach to the nature, scope, and level of empirical studies, particularly in their treatment of micro/macro analysis.The paper concludes that the differences are less significant than it may appear at first and that some of ANT’s ideas are close to Foucault’s position.However, ANT focuses on actors and their actions as they are performed in a particular time and place and does not appear to be concerned to what extent they may be historically conditioned. Thus, ANT on its own, in the view of the author, might not offer sufficient explanations as to why the actors under study take particular actions and why some actors are excluded or marginalized from the innovation process, e.g. from the development and implementation of an IS. For these reasons this paper suggests a critical research agenda enriched by ANT insights.</p>
