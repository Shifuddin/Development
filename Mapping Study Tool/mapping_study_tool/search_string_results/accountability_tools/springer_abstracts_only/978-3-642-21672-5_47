                          <p class="Para">The overarching goal of UA is affording all individuals, regardless of disabilities, geographic status, infrastructure, age or training background, the use and benefit of information technology. The goal of this paper is to raise awareness of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">the security and privacy cyber risks in the everyday use of UA technology</em>. The challenge of UA technology transfer from the laboratory to real world setting leads us to identify vulnerabilities of UA users and to present examples of cyber security strategies to safeguard data. The principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability guide our non-exhaustive review of concrete UA approaches and their security and privacy implications for everyday use. We examine the cyber risks to privacy and security of brain computer interfaces and UA home networking and conclude with call to interdisciplinary collaboration between the security and UA expert communities to ensure the transitioning of safe and secure UA technologies to the end-users.</p>
