                          <p class="Para">Based on the nomenclature of the early papers in the field, we propose a set of terminology which is both expressive and precise. More particularly, we define <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">anonymity, unlinkability, unobservability</em>, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pseudonymity</em> (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">pseudonyms</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">digital pseudonyms</em>, and their attributes). We hope that the adoption of this terminology might help to achieve better progress in the field by avoiding that each researcher invents a language of his/her own from scratch. Of course, each paper will need additional vocabulary, which might be added consistently to the terms defined here.</p>
