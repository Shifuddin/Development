                        <p class="Para">This paper introduces a simple categorisation of school performance feedback systems. It explores how a cross-national review of systems in each category, using a number of selected criteria, can identify features that warrant development, if user accessibility is to be enhanced in the future. The paper indicates potential value to be gained from both a deeper and a wider crossnational study.</p>
