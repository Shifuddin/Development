                          <p class="Para">This paper discusses the nature of the global IT industry and explores the issues of attempting to impose minimum standards of competence, knowledge and conduct on such a disparate workforce. The paper proceeds to explain the rationale for the approach taken by the International Federation for Information Processingâ€™s (IFIP) International Professional Practice Partnership (IP3) and how it is being implemented. It is compared with the International Professional Engineer (IntPE) scheme of the International Engineering Alliance. Finally, the paper explains how IP3 understands that IITP will bring additional member benefits for IFIP member societies and also additional candidates coming forward to sit for suitable examinations offered by a arrange of third parties.</p>
