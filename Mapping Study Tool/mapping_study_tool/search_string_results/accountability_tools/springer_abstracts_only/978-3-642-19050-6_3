                          <p class="Para">Many people will have an image of ‘who they are’ and how their identity is established. Moreover, most individuals will probably relate the concept of identity (and identity management) to their reputation as an individual, how they define themselves, and how others look at them. In this view, identity relates to the personal aspect of identity. However, the term identity is also used in many other ways, for instance in the sense of cultural identity — what makes an Englishman English? —, or in the sense of identity management in IT systems. Because of this, a clear definition of ‘identity’ is difficult to provide.</p>
