                          <p class="Para">The explosive growth of data networks and their commercial application is driving the need for improved security. This paper aims to raise awareness of the features of secure data networks and the role that encryption plays in this context. An overview of data network security is provided by examining a number of currently available technologies, and how they may be combined to provide a secure network. This is illustrated by a review of existing and proposed encryption services offered by BT/Concert. Taking a glimpse into the future, the ATM Forum's proposals for security in ATM networks are summarised.</p>
