                          <p class="Para">In the paper we present an approach to the architectural trust case development for DRIVE, the IT infrastructure supporting the processes of drugs distribution and application. The objectives of DRIVE included safer and cheaper drugs distribution and application. A trust case represents an argument supporting the trustworthiness of the system. It is decomposed into claims that postulate some trust related properties. Claims differ concerning their abstraction level and scope. To express a claim we need a language and a conceptual model. We used UML to represent claim models and related context models of the trust case. To specify claims we introduced <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Claim Definition Language</em> â€“ CDL. The paper gives a deeper description of the above concepts and illustrates how they were applied in practice.</p>
