                            <p class="Para">In Ubiquitous Computing Environment (UCE), service provider wants to provide its service to only legitimate users. Some users who belong to same service provider do not want to reveal their identities while using some privacy-related services such as location information, printing, browsing web pages, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">etc</em>. In addition, we should consider lightweight cryptographic protocols because UCE can be constructed by lots of resource and energy constrained devices. In this paper we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving authentication and access control scheme for UCE. Compared to the previous schemes [13,14], our proposed scheme which was designed to reduce the number of public key operations and to improve non-linkability feature is found to be more secure and requires less memory on the userâ€™s device. Moreover the proposed scheme provides mutual authentication, accountability and differentiated access control.</p>
