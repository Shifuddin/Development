                          <p class="Para">This article introduces POSeM, a method that uses business process descriptions to derive appropriate security safeguards. This is achieved by assigning security levels to the components of a business process such as actors, artefacts, and activities with a specially developed description language. These levels are checked for consistency, and security measures are derived using a configurable rule base that maps security objectives to safeguards. POSeM in practice is illustrated by an application to electronic business, i.e., the publication process of information for a company's web-site. Both the advantages of POSeM and its possible refinements are discussed.</p>
