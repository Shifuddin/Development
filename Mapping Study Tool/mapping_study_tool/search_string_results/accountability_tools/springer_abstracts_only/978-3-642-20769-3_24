                          <p class="Para">Organisations are facing huge pressure to assure their users about the privacy protection of their personal data. Organisations may need to consult the privacy policies of their users when deciding who should access their personal data. The user’s privacy policy will need to be combined with the organisation’s own policy, as well as policies from different authorities such as the issuer of the data, and the law. The authorisation system will need to ensure the enforcement of all these policies. We have designed a system that will ensure the enforcement of multiple privacy policies within an organisation and throughout a distributed system. The current paper is an enhanced version of [1] and it takes the research one step further.</p>
