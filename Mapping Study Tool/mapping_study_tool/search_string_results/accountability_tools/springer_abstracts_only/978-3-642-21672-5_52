                          <p class="Para">Cloud computing holds great promise for addressing the barriers that keep people with disabilities, low literacy and aging-related impairments from fully engaging with technology. However, using cloud-based computing to make assistive technology (AT) more widely available also raises legal and policy issues. The Americans with Disabilities Act, United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Communications Act, and other disability rights laws support increased availability of AT. However, what should the balance be between built-in accessibility and cloud-based access? There are also limits to the requirements and coverage of these laws, and issues about the definition of accessibility as technology develops. Copyright and digital rights are potentially implicated by cloud-based AT, as well as privacy and security rights. The needed infrastructure and interoperability of cloud based AT may raise concerns for technology developers that regulation may stifle innovation or reduce commercial viability.</p>
