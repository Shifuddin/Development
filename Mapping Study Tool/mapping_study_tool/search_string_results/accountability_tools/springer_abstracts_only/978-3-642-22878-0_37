                          <p class="Para">Intermediary service providers are important users and actors of eGovernment. This paper explores future longer-term collaborative models and partnerships between the public sector and divers new intermediaries. Four distinguished and logical scenarios of public-private cooperation around 2015 have been developed. Each ‘extrema’ presents a plausible future and specific implications and effects regarding the future role and position of the intermediary (e-)service providers. Whereas the current state-of-the-art shows a wide variety of intermediate roles, each of the future scenarios tends to stress one specific role. Being prepared for these futures is a major competitive advantage. The scenarios present the framework for assessing the impact of societal trends and present a test bed for the design of future-proof eGovernment strategies.</p>
