                          <p class="Para">In recent years, several case studies have emerged illustrating the impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and in particular the expansion of the Internet and mobile cell phones on socio-political activities. This paper investigates 146 economies and the relationship between the global expansion of ICTs and the current degree of democracy within each nation by constructing an index of e-democracy opportunities among them, for the period of 1995 to 2005. The key findings in this study are (a) a notable progress in e-democracy opportunity on the global stage; (b) the fact that in some countries there is a rapid ICT expansion and global success in e-democracy, and yet, there is a growing digital divide between the most and least developed e-democratic nations.</p>
