                          <p class="Para">Service providers (SPs) that allow anonymous access need to protect their services against misbehaving users. Several schemes are proposed to achieve anonymous revocation without a trusted third party, thus protecting usersâ€™ privacy. They either have linear computational complexity in the size of the blacklist (EPID, BLAC, BLACR), or require all misbehaviors being identified in a time window (PEREA, PERM).</p>
                          <p class="Para">In ESORICS 2012, Yu <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">et al</em> propose an efficient scheme called PE(AR)<sup>2</sup> which does not require the SPs to review sessions in a timely manner. However, we find there are security problems in PE(AR)<sup>2</sup>. We propose ARBRA, a reputation-based revocation system for which the SPs can assign positive or negative scores to anonymous sessions and block the users whose reputations are not high enough. ARBRA allows the SPs to ramp up penalties for repeated misbehaviors from the same user and does not require the SPs to judge misbehaviors within a time window. Our benchmark shows that ARBRA has the best performance on the SP side among existing schemes and is also efficient on the user side even if the misbehavior list contains one million entries.</p>
