                        <p class="Para">The internet revolution and modern applications require more bandwidth capacity as a result of the increasing amount of people using e.g. web-based applications with their enhanced quality and performance. Today, modern networks like ATM and SDH/SONET do not only have to fulfill the demand of higher transmission rates but also have to provide and to guarantee data security and especially data confidentiality. Therefore, new or modified cryptographic modes of operation are required. These modes provoke an error propagation which has an impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters of the network. The influences on an ATM network are examined for the CBC, Statistical Counter Mode, a new mode of operation and the ATM Counter Mode, which needs additional bandwidth for synchronization purposes. For SDH/SONET networks we suggest another mode of operation, called the Statistical Self-Synchronization, combining the advantages of the CFB and OFB mode. In synchronous networks it is the only mode that does not require additional bandwidth and is self-synchronizing with acceptable augmentation of error rates. The impact on the error performance is discussed and guidelines for adjusting selected cryptographic parameters are presented.</p>
