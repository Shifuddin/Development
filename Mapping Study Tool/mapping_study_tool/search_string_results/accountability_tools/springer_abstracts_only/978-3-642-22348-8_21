                          <p class="Para">With tackling the dilemma between the privacy concern and information utilization in mind, an efficient pairing-based instantiation of a new primitive, which we call Selective Disclosure scheme, is proposed in this paper. Selective Disclosure scheme allows the document issuer to distribute and publish the outsourced document in a secure way such that it achieves fine-grained authorized reading by selective parts in a document to different visitors and only one copy is needed. It is proved secure against fully adaptive adversaries in the random oracle model. The Selective Disclosure technique will be of use by embedding or integrating it into various word processors, e-mail,.etc.</p>
