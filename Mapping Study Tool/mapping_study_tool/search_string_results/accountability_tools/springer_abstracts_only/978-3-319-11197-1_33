                        <p class="Para">Cloud storage allows owners to host their data in the cloud, and provides users with online access anywhere and anytime. With CP-ABE, data owners are allowed to specify policy autonomously, which can realize fine-grained access control. However, some important problems have not been yet effectively solved: 1) Low efficiency for attribute revocation. 2) High computational cost on encryption and decryption. Even if <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">direct revocation</em> has been proposed for a user’s attributes, all ciphertexts with revoked attributes have to be re-encrypted. In this paper, we propose an access control scheme using version key to realize efficient <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">direct cloud-aided attribute revocation</em> without updating other user’s key or re-encrypting ciphertexts. Revocation of a user’s attributes just needs to update his own private key and version key stored in a cloud server, and most of decrypting work is transferred to the cloud. Moreover, we compare our scheme with two other schemes (DAC-MACS and HUR). The comparison shows a good trade-off between computation cost and storage overhead. Our simulation indicates that our scheme spends less time on a user’s attribute revocation.</p>
