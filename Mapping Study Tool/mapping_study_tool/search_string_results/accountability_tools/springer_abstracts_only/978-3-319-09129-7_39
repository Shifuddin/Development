                          <p class="Para">Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) features a specific type of “user-generated content" that involves spatial data. Geobrowsers are environments that present spatial data dynamically and can be accessed through a compatible browser. A Geobrowser can own a collaborative Web system to collect VGI. This paper presents the ClickOnMap, a framework to develop collaborative environments in Geobrowsers in a quick and standardized way. The framework has an architecture to document VGI and supports the generation of metadata following the rules of a dynamic metadata template for VGI called DM4VGI. Thus, the data can be interoperable with other systems that do not use ClickOnMap. CidadãoViçosaMG is a system to collect VGI about Viçosa city that was developed from ClickOnMap. The VGI collected in this system was documented using the DM4VGI template. The paper presents a quantitative analysis of VGI collected and of dynamic metadata generated to assess the usability of ClickOnMap along with DM4VGI.</p>
