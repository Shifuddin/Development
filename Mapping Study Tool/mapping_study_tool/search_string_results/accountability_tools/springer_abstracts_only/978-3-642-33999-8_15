                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we propose a provenance model able to represent the provenance of any data object captured at any abstraction layer and present an abstract schema of the model. The expressive nature of the model enables a wide range of provenance queries. We also illustrate the utility of our model in real world data processing systems.</p>
