                            <p class="Para">Attribute-based encryption brings a lot of convenience for access control. But it introduces several challenges with regard to the user revocation. In this paper, we propose an access control mechanism using new key update technology to enforce access control policies with efficient user revocation capability. The access control can be achieved by efficient key update technology which takes advantage of the attribute-based encryption and key distribution. We demonstrate how to apply the proposed mechanism to securely manage the cloud data. The analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure in user revocation.</p>
