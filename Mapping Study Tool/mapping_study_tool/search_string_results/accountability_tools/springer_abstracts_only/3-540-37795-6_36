                        <p class="Para">We consider an emerging class of distributed applications that make use of a variety of Internet services provided by different organizations. This naturally leads to information sharing and interactions across organizational boundaries. However, despite the need to share information and services, organizations will want to maintain their autonomy and privacy. Organizations will therefore require their interactions with other organizations to be strictly controlled and policed. By this we mean that: (i) relationships between organizations for information access and sharing will need to be regulated by contracts, which will need to be defined and agreed and then enforced and monitored; and (ii) organizations will need to establish appropriate trust relationships with each other and implement corresponding security policies before permitting interactions to take place.</p>
