                          <p class="Para">Addressing new public challenges such as the one-stop government and improved service quality, we introduce serviceflow management as a generic concept to coordinate cross-organizational e-government processes. Aiming at a serviceflow management infrastructure for networked service providers we present an XML-based process representation of serviceflows as well as a four layered IT architecture for realizing serviceflow related applications.</p>
                          <p class="Para">The research presented is exemplified by the case of citizens applying for postal vote through the web portal of the city state of Hamburg (Germany). The discussion includes how XML-based process representations for e-government serviceflows enable governmental actors to enter the network age without high investment burdens, but with many options for creating the service-oriented government of the future.</p>
