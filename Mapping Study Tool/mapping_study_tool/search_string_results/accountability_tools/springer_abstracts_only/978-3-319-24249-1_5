                          <p class="Para">This paper describes a method to create assurance cases for the Open Dependability through Assuredness (O-DA) standard of The Open Group (TOG) based on ArchiMate. ArchiMate provides Enterprise Architecture (EA) models to describe Business, Application and Technology Architectures. Although O-DA shows the necessity of agreeing on the assuredness of EA using assurance cases, O-DA does not mention how to create assurance cases for EA. In this paper, an assurance case pattern is proposed to argue the assuredness for these three kinds of architectures modelled by ArchiMate.</p>
