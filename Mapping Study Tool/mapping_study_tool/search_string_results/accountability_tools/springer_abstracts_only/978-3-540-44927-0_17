                          <p class="Para">The previous chapters presented results of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SEMPER</em>. In this last chapter, we step back and review issues that we encountered in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SEMPER</em> where more work–research, development or deployment–is necessary in the future. We do not aim at reviewing the state of the art, but rather present the open problems and the directions the work should take.</p>
                          <p class="Para">We start with purely non-technical issues, such as insufficient user education and the impact of crypto regulations. Next we discuss global issues related to architecture, then issues related to services and protocols, and finally implementation issues.</p>
