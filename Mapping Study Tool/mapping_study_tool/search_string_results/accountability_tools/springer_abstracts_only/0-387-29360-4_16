                          <p class="Para">Trust building is a vital issue and enabler for e-Business. It has been studied at various stages of e-Business from initial trust establishment, contract negotiation and formation, fulfilment to closure. Current studies mainly focus on building trust through the improvement of the social business environment and online security by adopting latest technologies. This paper introduces a new trust building approach developed in the eHUBs (e-Engineering enabled by Holonomic and Universal Broker Services) project. Unlike most of the current trust building studies. this approach fosters trust building between Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) and their clients through collaborative project planning (PP). The e-Hub provides a transparent, traceable and predictable collaborative PP and contract negotiation platform.</p>
