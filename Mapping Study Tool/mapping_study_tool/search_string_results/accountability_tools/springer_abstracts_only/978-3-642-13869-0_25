                          <p class="Para">Botnets pose a growing threat to the nationâ€™s critical digital infrastructure and general level of cybersecurity. Several strategies for reducing the threat of botnets have been outlined in the cyber security literature. These strategies typically call for both Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and home Internet users to adopt a greater share of the responsibility for overall security. However, to date no study has attempted to determine how accepting the public would be of these strategies. This study takes the first step in filling that gap. The results of this pilot survey suggest that, in general, individuals would be willing to spend additional time each month meeting security requirements set by their ISPs. The results also suggest that although only 50% of respondents would be willing to pay their ISP more per month to protect themselves from cyber threats, more people would be willing to do so if they perceived ISPs as being effective or very effective at reducing such threats. The findings provide important guidance for policy makers and ISPs seeking to gain support for such strategies.</p>
