                          <p class="Para">We present an implementation of a policy-based management architecture for emerging communications and computing paradigms such as Active Networks and the Grid. To manage such open, highly distributed and decentralized environments, an approach based on policy concepts is adopted, allowing support for active, dynamic adaptability in network elements, services and end-user applications, as well as achieving decentralization and distribution. We present our flexible, extensible policy and event specifications in XML, and describe our management architecture. One key feature of our approach is the distributed infrastructure: the Directory and the Management Information Distribution system. The second feature is the Resource and Security Management elements residing on the multi-node managed systems. These combine to provide a light-weight, self-organizing management architecture. As an applications example, we describe the implementation of our management system applied to the Application Level Active Networking (ALAN) environment, implemented in the European Commission Information Society Technologies (IST) project ANDROID.</p>
