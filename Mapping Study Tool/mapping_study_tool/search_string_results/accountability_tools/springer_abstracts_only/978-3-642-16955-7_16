                          <p class="Para">This paper presents <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">LiFTinG</span>, the first protocol to detect freeriders, including colluding ones, in gossip-based content dissemination systems with asymmetric data exchanges. <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">LiFTinG</span> relies on nodes tracking abnormal behaviors by cross-checking the history of their previous interactions, and exploits the fact that nodes pick neighbors at random to prevent colluding nodes from covering up each othersâ€™ bad actions.</p>
                          <p class="Para">We present a methodology to set the parameters of <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">LiFTinG</span> based on a theoretical analysis. In addition to simulations, we report on the deployment of <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">LiFTinG</span> on PlanetLab. In a 300-node system, where a stream of 674 kbps is broadcast, <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">LiFTinG</span> incurs a maximum overhead of only 8% while providing good results: for instance, with 10% of freeriders decreasing their contribution by 30%, <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">LiFTinG</span> detects 86% of the freeriders after only 30 seconds and wrongfully expels only a few honest nodes.</p>
