                          <p class="Para">Using the literature and drawing upon several decades of experience in risk analysis, the author identifies three elements that appear particularly challenging for port security applications. The first of these is identifying a set of realistic scenarios for risk assessment. The second is estimating the likelihood of a successful attack on a port. The third is understanding the regional and national economic consequences of these events. The author offers suggestions for addressing these challenges.</p>
