                          <p class="Para">Mobile smart devices and services have become an integral part of our daily life. In this context there are many compelling scenarios for mobile device users to share resources. A popular example is tethering. However, sharing resources also raises privacy and security issues.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we present <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">CrowdShare</span>, a complete framework and its (Android) implementation for secure and private resource sharing among nearby devices. <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">CrowdShare</span> provides pseudonymity for users, accountability of resource usage, and the possibility of specifying access control in terms of social network relationships. Further, <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">CrowdShare</span> preserves secure connectivity between nearby devices even in the absence of the mobile infrastructure. We have implemented <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">CrowdShare</span> on Android devices and report good performance results.</p>
