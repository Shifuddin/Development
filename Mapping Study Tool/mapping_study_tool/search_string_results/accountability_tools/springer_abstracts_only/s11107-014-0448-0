                          <p class="Para">This paper discusses architecture, protocol, technologies, systems, and networking testbed for software-defined elastic optical networking in temporal, spectral, and spatial domains. By exploiting the progress in elastic optical networking (EON) in temporal and spectral domains utilizing dynamic optical arbitrary waveform generation and measurement technologies, and by extending the EON concept into the spatial domain through the new orbital angular momentum-based spatial division multiplexing, we realize EON exploiting elasticity in temporal, spectral, and spatial domains (3D-EON). Routing, spectral, spatial mode, and modulation format assignment with fragmentation awareness as well as hitless defragmentation for high capacity, high quality of service, and resource-efficient networking will be pursued. OpenFlow-based 3D-EON testbed at UC Davis includes optical supervisory channel with optical performance monitoring for software-defined networking with an adaptive observe-analyze-act cycle.</p>
