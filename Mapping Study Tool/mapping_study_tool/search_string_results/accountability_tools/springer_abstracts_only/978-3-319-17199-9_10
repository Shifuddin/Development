                            <p class="Para">This paper explores the legal aspects of Cloud accountability which are being examined in great detail in the Cloud Accountability Project. This paper first provides an overview of the basic legal framework of the US and the EU, addresses the lawmaking process, and the impact and enforcement of jurisdiction. The primary laws within the data protection framework are then further explored, as such regulations have the greatest impact on the Cloud, Cloud providers, Cloud customers, and, ultimate, Cloud users. This paper then explores the role of contracts in the Cloud. Finally, all of the analysis is pulled together in discussing how the Cloud Accountability Project is addressing these legal aspects and how such aspects should influence Cloud actors, especially Cloud providers, in their policies and legal governance.</p>
