                          <p class="Para">Through close examination of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">U.S. vs. Fiber Materials, Inc.</em>, this paper examines the documentation responsible for the overturning of a guilty verdict in one of the most highly acclaimed export control enforcement cases of the last decade. The jury’s verdict in the case was derived from the organizational memory of the regulating agency. Ultimately, historical records were unearthed which proved the agency’s memory to be egregiously inaccurate, and the defendants, after nearly twenty million dollars in legal fees and eight years in legal limbo, were subsequently acquitted of all charges. This case study highlights the disconnect between traditional record keeping practices and digital information systems. It identifies a knowledge-to-task gap in the policy area of export controls. It suggests a need for further refinement of the contextual qualities and attributes necessary for policy knowledge and reuse.</p>
