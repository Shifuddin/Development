                            <p class="Para">We describe a service-oriented framework that supports how distributed enterprises can collaborate on doing work. Our model separates the concerns of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">doing</em> from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">managing </em>work. Work is modeled as a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">capability</em> and can be provided as a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">service</em> by some organization. A desired business outcome can then be described by its required capabilities. The framework enables dynamic composition of capabilities into <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">just-in-time service plans </em>that can be executed collaboratively by distributed organizations. A Hub is used to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">manage</em> and coordinate the overall work. It comprises stakeholders from the collaborating organizations. The Hubâ€™s infrastructure enables them to see the big picture, detect issues early, decide on the best response, and quickly enact their decision. Executing service plans can then be modified in real-time, providing the enterprise with agility and flexibility.</p>
