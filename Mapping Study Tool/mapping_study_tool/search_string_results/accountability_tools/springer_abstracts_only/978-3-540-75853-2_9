                          <p class="Para">A collaborative system for dynamic refinement of security in peer-to-peer and mobile ad hoc networks is described in this paper. This is based on a closed loop system where live distributed trust measures are used to modify access control settings in a changing threat environment. A service oriented trust overlay architecture and model underlies this system. In this model, services have associated trust thresholds â€“ the more sensitive the service, the higher the threshold. The results of simulations of the dynamics of this kind of system are presented and a variety of algorithmic approaches to managing trust are analysed and discussed. It is demonstrated that this dynamic system has the potential to enhance security and access control efficiency and that it displays properties of robustness when faced with malicious entities that attempt to corrupt the system.</p>
