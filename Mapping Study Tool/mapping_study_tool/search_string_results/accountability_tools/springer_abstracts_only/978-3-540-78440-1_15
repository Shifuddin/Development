                          <p class="Para">Non-transferability of digital signatures is an important security concern, traditionally achieved via interactive verification protocols. Such protocols, however, are vulnerable to “online transfer attacks” — i.e., attacks mounted during the protocols’ executions.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we show how to guarantee <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">online untransferability</em> of signatures, via a reasonable public-key infrastructure and general assumptions, without random oracles. Our untransferable signatures are as efficient as prior ones that provably provide weaker types of untransferability.</p>
