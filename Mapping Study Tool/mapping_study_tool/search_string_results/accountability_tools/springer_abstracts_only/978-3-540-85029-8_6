                          <p class="Para">There is a growing interest in the study and development of self-* systems motivated by the need for information systems capable of self-management in distributed, open, and dynamic scenarios. Unfortunately,there is a lack of frameworks that support the intricate task of developing self-* systems. We try to make headway along this direction by introducing a framework, EIDE-*, to support the engineering of a particular type of self-* systems, namely <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">autonomic electronic institutions</em>: regulated environments capable of adapting their norms to comply with institutional goals despite the varying behaviours of their participating agents.</p>
