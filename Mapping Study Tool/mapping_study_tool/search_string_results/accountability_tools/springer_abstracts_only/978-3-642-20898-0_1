                          <p class="Para">In the near future, the high volume of content together with new emerging and mission critical applications is expected to stress the Internet to such a degree that it will possibly not be able to respond adequately to its new role. This challenge has motivated many groups and research initiatives worldwide to search for structural modifications to the Internet architecture in order to be able to face the new requirements. This paper is based on the results of the Future Internet Architecture (FIArch) group organized and coordinated by the European Commission (EC) and aims to capture the groupâ€™s view on the Future Internet Architecture issue.</p>
