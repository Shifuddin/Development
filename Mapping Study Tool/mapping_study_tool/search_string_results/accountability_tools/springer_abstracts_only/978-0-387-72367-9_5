                          <p class="Para">Trusted Computing is a security base technology that will perhaps be ubiquitous in a few years in personal computers and mobile devices alike.

We show that trusted computing can be applied for service access control in a manner protecting users’ privacy. We construct a ticket system, a concept at the heart of Identity Management, relying solely on the capabilities of the trusted platform module and the Trusted Computing Group’s standards. Two examples show how it can be used for pseudonymous, protected service access.</p>
