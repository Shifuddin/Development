                          <p class="Para">A “Social System” enabled by ICT, such as Intelligent Transportation System affects society itself as well as users’ behavior. When designing these systems, an approach of having users or citizens in the center of the system is most cru<strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">c</strong>ial to derive planned use of the system. In this study, examples of social systems in the fields of transportation and e-government are first reviewed to reveal the history and issues, and then defined the definition of a “social system.” A case example is made on ITS in regard with obtaining higher quality in use by employing Human-centered Design. The necessity of broadening conventional HCD methodologies is further discussed.</p>
