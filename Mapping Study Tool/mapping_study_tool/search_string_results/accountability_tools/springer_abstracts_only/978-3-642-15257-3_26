                          <p class="Para">Anonymous credentials are discussed as a privacy friendlier replacement for public key certificates. While such a transition would help to protect the privacy of digital citizens in the emerging information society, the wide scale deployment of anonymous credentials still poses many challenges. One of the open technical issues is the efficient revocation of anonymous credentials. Currently, accumulator based revocation is considered to be the most efficient and most privacy friendly mechanism for revoking anonymous credentials. This paper analyses the performance of three accumulator based credential revocation schemes. It identifies the bottlenecks of those implementations and presents guidelines to improve the efficiency in concrete applications.</p>
