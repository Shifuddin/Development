Data complexity in education is increasing as people store both structured data in relational format and unstructured data such as Word or PDF files, images, videos and geo-spatial data. Indeed learning developers, universities, and other educational sectors confirm that tremendous amount of data captured is in unstructured or semi-structured format. Educators, students, instructors, tutors, research developers and people who deal with educational data are also challenged by the velocity of different data types, organizations as well as institutes that process streaming data such as click streams from web sites, need to update data in real time to serve the right advert or present the right offers to their customers.
