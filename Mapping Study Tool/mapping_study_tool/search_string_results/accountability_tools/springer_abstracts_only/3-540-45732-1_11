                          <p class="Para">CORAS is a research and technological development project under the Information Society Technologies (IST) Programme (Commission of the European Communities, Directorate-General Information Society). One of the main objectives of CORAS is to develop a practical framework, exploiting methods for risk analysis, semiformal methods for object-oriented modelling, and computerised tools, for a precise, unambiguous, and efficient risk assessment of security critical systems. This paper presents the CORAS framework and the related conclusions from the CORAS project so far.</p>
