                          <p class="Para">Current usage of the expression “human-centred” in computing contexts suffers from a lack of clarity, and involves internal contradictions. It is not enough to base the concept of human-centredness on ideas of social utility, collaborative working or human controllability. However, the concept of human action (which embodies reference to human freedom) provides a theoretical underpinning to human-centredness by combining, from a human standpoint, concern with process and concern with goals. This has consequences for the design process, prompting us to include new concerns in our system specifications and providing some pointers towards human-centred design methodology.</p>
