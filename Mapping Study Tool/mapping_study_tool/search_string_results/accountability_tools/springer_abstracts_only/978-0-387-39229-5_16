                            <p class="Para">IT Governance has become an increasingly important process in delivering business value from IT. A number of IT governance frameworks have been proposed as the MIT â€” CISR framework and COBIT. However, there is no proposal of a systematic methodology for IT Governance assessment and design, considering the possibility of joint usage of multiple frameworks. This paper presents a systematic methodology for IT governance assessment and design, specified through different phases, their activities and outcomes. This methodology is applied in a real case showing the practical benefit from its usage.</p>
