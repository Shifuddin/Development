                          <p class="Para">This paper reports on some of the recently completed work of the EU-supported Prisma project examining the best of e-government experience across Europe in relation to technology, organisational change and meeting the needs of the user (citizens and business). Future work of Prisma involves developing scenarios of change over the next ten years, building future-oriented best practice models and providing comprehensible and useful tools for practitioners and researchers to guide their decision making and research priorities respectively. Apart from examining e-government and e-governance generally, Prisma is also examining six service areas in detail: administrations, health, persons with special needs (the disabled and elderly), environment, transport and tourism.</p>
