                        <p class="Para">Identity Mixer is an anonymous credential system developed at IBM that allows users for instance to prove that they are over 18 years old without revealing their name or birthdate. This privacy-friendly technology is realized using zero-knowledge proofs. We describe a formal model of Identity Mixer that is well-suited for automated protocol verification tools in the spirit of black-box cryptography models.</p>
