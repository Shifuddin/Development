                            <p class="Para">Many protocols rely on audit trails to allow an impartial judge to verify <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a posteriori</em> some property of a protocol run. However, in current practice the choice of what data to log is left to the programmerâ€™s intuition, and there is no guarantee that it constitutes enough evidence. We give a precise definition of auditability and we show how typechecking can be used to statically verify that a protocol always logs enough evidence. We apply our approach to several examples, including a full-scale auction-like protocol programmed in ML.</p>
