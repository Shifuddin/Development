                          <p class="Para">This paper explores the possibilities that semantic and social web technologies offer for enhancing official publications—and particularly official gazettes—, so that transparency and citizen participation are empowered. It is concluded that a quantum leap is possible by promoting, first of all, the automatic collection, presentation and comparison of data; secondly, the linking and reference of all the relevant evidence and documentation from different sources and, therefore, enhancing its use; and, finally, by allowing the public annotation and discussion around laws, norms and governmental acts. Ensuring the permanence of all this information is a key aspect of this effort. To sum up, promoting law and research programs that support a change in the way that official information and documents are published should get into the political and research agenda of all the parties and agents interested in promoting government for the citizens and from the citizens.</p>
