                          <p class="Para">The concept of community governance is generally intended as the management of complex processes underlying the inherent complexity of the environment.</p>
                          <p class="Para">As a matter of facts, this complex approach provides the diffused, delocalized and multiagent management processes taking place on settled territories with a multiscalar, multisectoral and transdisciplinary vision.</p>
                          <p class="Para">The aspects of interest of this study about the governance theme deal with the definition of an ICT-based, multiple-agent systems (MAS) for the representation of knowledge, roles, relationships, tasks and operational levels involved in governance processes. This model is oriented toward the construction of MAS-based system architectures to support development policymaking, managed through process models of community governance.</p>
                          <p class="Para">The paper starts with a first general introduction on the research background of the paper, particularly governance and multi-agent systems. A second chapter discusses multi-agent modelling and the practical case-study of Foggia (Italy). Concluding remarks end up the paper.</p>
