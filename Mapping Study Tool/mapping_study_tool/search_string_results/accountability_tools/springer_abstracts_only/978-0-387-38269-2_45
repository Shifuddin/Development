                          <p class="Para">Nowadays, we can observe the transition of traditional business to electronic one, where negotiations still play very important role. In the paper we propose a general model of human negotiations and on the basis of which we have created a simplified model of quality analysis. The proposed quality model allows us to define various negotiation scenarios and to evaluate such negotiation metrics as completeness, effectiveness, performance and satisfaction. Two kinds of negotiations (f2f and chat) have been compared for buying/selling scenarios. More than 150 experiments have been carried out taking into account negotiation quality. Firstly, analysis has been made to examine the impact of negotiator personalities, experiences, roles and positions on that quality. Secondly, further studies have shown how negotiation quality is influenced by various types of negotiation strategies.</p>
