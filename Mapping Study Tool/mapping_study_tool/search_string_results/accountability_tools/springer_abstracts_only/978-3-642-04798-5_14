                          <p class="Para">Track configurations at cross-domain interchange points, train performance characteristics and cross-domain authentication often produce significant train delays that can impact large segments of a railroad network. This paper presents a model that captures the behavior of trains and the track infrastructure. The model enables railroad signal engineers to quickly estimate the required trust management system performance that will support safe, secure and efficient railroad operations.</p>
