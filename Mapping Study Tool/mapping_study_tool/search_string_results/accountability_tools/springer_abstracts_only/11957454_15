                          <p class="Para">Protection of information confidentiality can result in obstruction of legitimate access to necessary resources. This paper explores the problem of pairing resource requestors and providers such that neither must sacrifice privacy. While solutions to similar problems exist, these solutions are inadequate or inefficient in the context of private resource pairing. This work explores private resource-pairing solutions under two models of participant behavior: honest-but-curious behavior and potentially malicious behavior. Without compromising security, the foundation of these solutions demonstrates significant performance benefits over a popular solution to the similar private matching problem.</p>
