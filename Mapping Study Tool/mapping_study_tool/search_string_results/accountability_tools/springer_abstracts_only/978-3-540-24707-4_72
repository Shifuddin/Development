                          <p class="Para">IT Security evaluation based on Common Criteria (CC, ISO/IEC15408), international standard for evaluation of security properties of IT products and systems, requires evaluation deliverables such as development and operational documents of TOE(Target of Evaluation) according to EAL(Evaluation Assurance Level). As most developers commonly prepare evaluation deliverables after their products have been developed, additional costs and time have been invested to be ready for evaluation evidences in reverse-engineering. But CC does not provide any methodological support to prepare evaluation deliverables, and furthermore, related work is not sufficient. In this paper, we present how Common Criteria apply to development process of VPN (Virtual Private Network). We demonstrate our idea by means of case study â€“ developing RVPN V1.0 according to EAL4 in CC.</p>
