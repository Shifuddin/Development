                        <p class="Para">Sanitizable signatures allow a designated entity to modify some specific parts of a signed message and to produce a new signature of the resulting message without any interaction with the original signer. In this paper, we extend these sanitizable signatures to formally introduce <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">trapdoor sanitizable signatures</em>. In this concept, the power of sanitization is given to possibly several entities, for a given message/signature by using a trapdoor computed by the signer at any time. We also give a generic construction of such trapdoor sanitizable signatures. Eventually, we apply our new cryptographic tool to group content protection, permitting members of the group to distribute a protected content among themselves.</p>
