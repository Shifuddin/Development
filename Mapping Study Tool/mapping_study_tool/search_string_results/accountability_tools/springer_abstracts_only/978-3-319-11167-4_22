                          <p class="Para">To secure the message transmission in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), the hybrid authentication protocol was proposed. The aggregated signcryption scheme was used to authenticate the private vehicular while protect them from being leak the identities. The aggregated signature was used to authenticate the public vehicular. And the batch-verification was employed to reduce the overheads also. Compared with the existed schemes, the proposal reduced the message overhead 15% at least, and speedup 50% in signing operation. Besides, the simulation experiment also shows that it has the lower communication delay and smaller message loss ratio than others.</p>
