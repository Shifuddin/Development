                            <p class="Para">One future challenge in informatics is the integration of humans in an infrastructure of data-centric IT services. A critical activity of this infrastructure is trustworthy information exchange to reduce threats due to misuse of (personal) information. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Privacy by Design</em> as the present methodology for developing privacy-preserving and secure IT systems aims to reduce security vulnerabilities already in the early requirement analysis phase of software development. Incident reports show, however, that not only an implementation of a model bears vulnerabilities but also the gap between rigorous view of threat and security model on the world and real view on a run-time environment with its dependencies. Dependencies threaten reliability of information, and in case of personal information, privacy as well. With the aim of improving security and privacy during run-time, this work proposes to extend <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Privacy by Design</em> by adapting an IT system not only to inevitable security vulnerabilities but in particular to their usersâ€™ view on an information exchange and its IT support with different, eventually opposite security interests.</p>
