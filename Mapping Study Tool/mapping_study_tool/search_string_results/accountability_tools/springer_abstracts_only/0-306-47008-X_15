                        <p class="Para">One of the central objectives of studying database privacy protection is to protect sensitive information held in a database from being inferred by a generic database user. In this paper, we present a framework to assist in the formal analysis of the database inference problem. The framework is based on an association network which is composed of a similarity measure and a Bayesian network model.</p>
