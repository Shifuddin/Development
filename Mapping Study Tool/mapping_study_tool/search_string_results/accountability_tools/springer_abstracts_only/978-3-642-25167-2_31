                          <p class="Para">In this paper we explore the theoretical concept of trust by putting it in to play empirically. Influences of trust on an Intranet based leader strategy in a big organisation are investigated. We also discuss other significant features that affect success or no success of such approach. The presentation builds on an interview study in one district of Stockholm, Norrmalm, and a survey committed in two districts of this city (Spånga-Tensta and Skärholmen). This paper is conducted in the field of Human Computer Interaction.</p>
