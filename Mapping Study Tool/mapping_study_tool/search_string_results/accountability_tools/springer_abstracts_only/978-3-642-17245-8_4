                          <p class="Para">Cooperating systems typically base decisions on information from their own components as well as on input from other systems. Safety critical decisions based on cooperative reasoning however raise severe concerns to security issues. Here, we address the security requirements elicitation step in the security engineering process for such systems of systems. The method comprises the tracing down of functional dependencies over system component boundaries right onto the origin of information as a functional flow graph. Based on this graph, we systematically deduce comprehensive sets of formally defined authenticity requirements for the given security and dependability objectives. The proposed method thereby avoids premature assumptions on the security architectureâ€™s structure as well as the means by which it is realised. Furthermore, a tool-assisted approach that follows the presented methodology is described.</p>
