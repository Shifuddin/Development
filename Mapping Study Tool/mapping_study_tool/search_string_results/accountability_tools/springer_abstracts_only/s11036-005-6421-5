                          <p class="Para">In recent years, wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) have established Wi-Fi hotspots in increasing numbers at public venues, providing local coverage to traveling users and empowering them with the ability to access email, Web, and other Internet applications on the move. In this paper, we observe that while the mobile computing landscape has changed both in terms of number and type of hotspot venues, there are several technological and deployment challenges remaining before hotspots can become an ubiquitous infrastructure. These challenges include authentication, security, coverage, management, location services, billing, and interoperability. We discuss existing research, the work of standards bodies, and the experience of commercial hotspot providers in these areas, and then describe compelling open research questions that remain.</p>
