                          <p class="Para">The decentralised nature of web-based information systems demands a careful evaluation of the pantheon of security issues in order to avoid the potential occurrence of business risks that could not be easily mitigated. Understanding that information security is not merely a technical solution implemented at each one of the endpoints of the inter-organizational application, this paper presents an integrated approach based on a rigorous multi-level and multidimensional model. Through synthesis and aiming to contribute towards implementing the most effective security strategy possible, the approach has as a starting point the overall business goals and objectives. Based on those it aids the development of a strategy from the lower levels of securing data in storage and transition to the higher levels of business processes. Its use and applicability is demonstrated over ‘Billing Mall’ - a system for Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment.</p>
