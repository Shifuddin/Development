                          <p class="Para">Cognitive work analysis (CWA), a systems-based analysis framework, is intended to inform system design. However, there is little guidance available about how to use the framework in design. This paper identifies desirable methodological attributes for a new design approach for CWA and describes a process of refining these to a core set based on the opinions of CWA practitioners. The new design approach, the CWA Design Tool (CWA-DT), is outlined in terms of how it aligns with these core attributes. Finally, implications of application of the CWA-DT for road safety design will be identified and discussed.</p>
