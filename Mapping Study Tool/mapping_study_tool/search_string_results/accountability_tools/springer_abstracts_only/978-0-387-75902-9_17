                        <p class="Para">Spread out on the Internet, mail servers, and hard-drives everywhere, unstructured information in the form of Web pages, email, RSS feeds, office documents, images, video, and sound, accounts for approximately ten times the structured information stored in databases. Seeking to organize their large volume of non-structured content, companies implement Enterprise Content Management (ECM) systems to make this information more accessible for users and make these systems communicate with relational database backed solutions through a single interface. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and local governments also have the same need for unstructured information organization. However, most of times, they cannot afford the high acquisition and customization costs, or donâ€™t want to become dependent of proprietary ECM solutions. This paper aims to present NSI<sup>2</sup>, an ECM solution totally built on top of open source software that offers the functionalities demanded by this kind of system.</p>
