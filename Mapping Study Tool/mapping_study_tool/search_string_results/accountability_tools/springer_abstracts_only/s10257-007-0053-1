                          <p class="Para">The emergence of enterprise architecture (EA) as a mechanism for addressing increased complexity has resulted in a newly evolving profession of enterprise architect. This paper summarizes the results of a study that explored the role of the enterprise architect as viewed by subject matter experts within the executive branch of the US Federal Government. The results of the research study identified several functional roles of the enterprise architect and described the interfaces with other functional roles. The study determined the unique value that the role provides to the enterprise and the impact of not filling this role. The study examined the optimal organizational positioning and the competencies needed to maximize effectiveness in the role. The insights gained from this study are the first step in defining the role of the enterprise architect. This theory forms the foundation needed to support a recognized profession of enterprise architect and provides several recommendations for further research.</p>
