                          <p class="Para">This paper looks at privacy-enhanced uses of biometrics, with a particular focus on the privacy and security advantages of Biometric Encryption (BE). It considers the merits of Biometric Encryption for verifying identity, protecting privacy, and ensuring security. In doing so, it argues that BE technologies can help to overcome the prevailing “zero-sum” mentality, which posits that adding privacy to identification and information systems will necessarily weaken security and functionality. It explains how and why BE technology promises a “win-win” scenario for all stakeholders.</p>
