                          <p class="Para">Discovery of security vulnerabilities is on the rise. As a result, software development teams must place a higher priority on preventing the injection of vulnerabilities in software as it is developed. Because the focus on software security has increased only recently, software development teams often do not have expertise in techniques for identifying security risk, understanding the impact of a vulnerability, or knowing the best mitigation strategy. We propose the Protection Poker activity as a collaborative and informal form of misuse case development and threat modeling that plays off the diversity of knowledge and perspective of the participants. An excellent outcome of Protection Poker is that security knowledge passed around the team. Students in an advanced undergraduate software engineering course at North Carolina State University participated in a Protection Poker session conducted as a laboratory exercise. Students actively shared misuse cases, threat models, and their limited software security expertise as they discussed vulnerabilities in their course project. We observed students relating vulnerabilities to the business impacts of the system. Protection Poker lead to a more effective software security learning experience than in prior semesters. A pilot of the use of Protection Poker with an industrial partner began in October 2008. The first security discussion structured via Protection Poker caused two requirements to be revised for added security fortification; led to the immediate identification of one vulnerability in the system; initiated a meeting on the prioritization of security defects; and instigated a call for an education session on preventing cross site scripting vulnerabilities.</p>
