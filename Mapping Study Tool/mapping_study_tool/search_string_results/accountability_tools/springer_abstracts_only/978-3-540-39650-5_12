                        <p class="Para">Hardware security modules can be used to encapsulate simple security services that bind security functions such as decryption with authorisation and authentication. Such hardware secured services provide a functional root of trust that can be placed within context of a wider IT solution hence enabling strong separations of control and duty.</p>
                        <p class="Para">This paper describes an approach to using such hardware-encapsulated services to create virtual trust domains within a deployed solution. This trust domain is defined by the hardware protection regime, the service code and the policies under which it is managed. An example is given, showing how a TLS session within a web service environment can be protected and how this service can extend the secure communications into the backend systems.</p>
