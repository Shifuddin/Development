                          <p class="Para">Almost cloud service providers are having their own architectures for providing a variety of cloud services to their customers, cloud service clients. These various architectures and services increase the complexity of security management policies, frameworks, and systems, because they would require different aspects of security solutions for their own architectures and services. Consequently, such compatibility issues make us difficult to design a common security framework, security management system, or security evaluation system. Recognizing the need to solve such issues, we analyze common security elements to be required for cloud computing virtualization, and identify requirements for information protection in this paper. We also identify possible threats that may occur depending on different functions and roles over the cloud virtualization environments, and define security elements and requirements to deal with those issues. We show a set of common directions or approaches to prevent any possible treats to cloud computing, and provide more efficient and systematic method of managing and operating cloud computing system.</p>
