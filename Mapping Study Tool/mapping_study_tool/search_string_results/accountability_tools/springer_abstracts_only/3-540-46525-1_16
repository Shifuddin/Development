                          <p class="Para">This paper proposes an Accounting Management architecture, based on TINA principles. Accounting management is defined and positioned in the service provision chain. A relevant computational architecture is proposed and some of the involved computational entities are modeled as agents. A discussion follows on the merits of introducing agents to cater for certain accounting management activities. The ACTS AC325 MONTAGE project provides the main source of the presented work and results.</p>
