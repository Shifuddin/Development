                          <p class="Para">In a world where cyber crime is constantly increasing, pervasive computing is on the rise and information is becoming the most sought after commodity making an effective and efficient Information Security (IS) architecture and program essential. ‘With this improved technology and infrastructure, ongoing and pro-active computer investigations are now a mandatory component of the IS enterprise’ [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16">16</a></span>]. Corporate governance reports require that organizations should not only apply good corporate governance principles, but also practice good IT governance and specially IS governance. Organizations develop their security architectures based on current best practices for example [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21">21</a></span>] and [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12">12</a></span>]. These best practices do not consider the importance of putting controls or procedures in place that will ensure successful investigations. There is a definite need to adapt current Information Security (IS) best practices to include for example certain aspects of Digital Forensics (DF) readiness to the current best practices to address the shortcomings. Whilst IS and DF are considered as two different disciplines, there is a definite overlap between the two [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29">29</a></span>]. The aim of this paper is to examine the overlap between DF and IS, to determine the relevance of DF readiness to IS and propose the inclusion of certain aspects of DF readiness as a component for best practice for IS.</p>
