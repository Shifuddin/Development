                          <p class="Para">This paper starts from the empirical finding that privacy principles are not rated very high in current eGovernment architectures. This is problematic because it leads to a substantial <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">privacy erosion</em> and undermines the existing power relations between a government and its citizens with regard to a particularly valuable asset: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">personal data</em>. Precisely because of these power relations, there are very few incentives for government managers to implement Privacy-Enhanced Identity Management Systems <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">on a large scale</em> in an eGovernment architecture. Hereafter we introduce a less far-going alternative to Privacy-Enhanced Identity Management in eGovernment: “Privacy-Friendly Identity Management”. We conclude with a brief analysis of one important driver for government managers to choose for Privacy-Friendly Identity Management: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">risk management</em>
