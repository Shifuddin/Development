                          <p class="Para">This paper will discuss the security, privacy and interoperability of mobile health applications (MHAs) and how these issues must be reconciled in order for MHA devices to be implemented in the most robust fashion. Balance is needed between privacy and accessibility, between security and interoperability and between flexibility and standardization. The interoperability of diverse MHA devices must be a goal for the future in order to realize portability, true continuity and quality of care across a wide spectrum of health services. A pilot project to determine potential threats to the privacy of personal health information on an iPad will be described</p>
