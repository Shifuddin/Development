                          <p class="Para">an organized list of actual defects can be useful for software security test (SST). In order to target their technology on a rational basis, it would be useful for security testers to have available a taxonomy of software security defects organizing the problem space. Unfortunately, the only existing suitable taxonomies are mostly for tool-builders and software designers, or based on vulnerabilities and security errors, and do not adequately represent security defects that are found in modern software. In our work, we have reviewed the traditional software security errors or vulnerabilities taxonomies. Based on analyzing in its target, motivation and insufficiency, we have compared 9 kinds of taxonomies, which would be useful for defects based software security testing.</p>
