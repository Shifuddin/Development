                          <p class="Para">E-government includes fast and improved citizen service from a quantitative and qualitative point of view, as well as the restructuring and reengineering of organizations and their services, through the increased usage and exploitation of the capabilities and services of ICT’s and the Internet. The escalation of the e-government services begins with easy access to governmental information and passes through the e-transactions between citizens and the public organization and reaches the electronic delivery of the requested document. A prerequisite in order to support the aforementioned e-government services “layers” is the development of an electronic system, which supports e-protocol, e-applications/e-petitions and internal organizational function of the public organization. In addressing the above context, this article presents an e-government structure which supports and provides the aforementioned e-government services “layers” in order to provide public information dissemination, accept electronic document submissions, manage them through e-protocol and support the operations through the appropriate electronic structure.</p>
