                          <p class="Para">With the emergence of e-government and a novel concept of governance the role of knowledge has become dominant. Building a modern administration with new patterns of cooperation means that the redistribution of knowledge has to be designed and orchestrated carefully. This corresponds to the concept of “knowledge enhanced Government”. In the public realm there is cosmos of knowledge repositories and a plenitude of diverse processes. Thus, understanding the knowledge part in administrative processes is a must. This contribution investigates knowledge aspects in e-government and gives a survey on relevant knowledge issues in the public sector. Based on the comprehension of public sector knowledge, examples are considered where administrative work is enhanced with knowledge. Examples of such intelligent e-government processes are given in the second part of the paper: data interchange in routine processes, policy making and citizen advice. Next step of knowledge enhancement in e-government is to seamlessly interweave human and software expertise.</p>
