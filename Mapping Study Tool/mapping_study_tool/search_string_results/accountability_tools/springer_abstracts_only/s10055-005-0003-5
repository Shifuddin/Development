                          <p class="Para">Virtual role-playing environments can be a powerful mechanism of instruction, provided they are constructed such that learning how to play and win the game contributes to a player’s understanding of real-world concepts and procedures. North Dakota State University (NDSU) provides students with environments to enhance their understanding of geology (Planet Oit), cellular biology (Virtual Cell), programming languages (ProgrammingLand), retailing (Dollar Bay), and history (Blackwood). These systems present a number of opportunities and an equal number of challenges. Players are afforded a role-based, multi-user, ‘learn-by-doing’ experience, with software agents acting as both environmental effects and tutors and the possibilities of multi-user cooperation and collaboration. However, technical issues and one important cultural issue present a range of difficulties. The Dollar Bay environment, its particular challenges, and the solutions to these are presented.</p>
