                        <p class="Para">A distributed resource environment (DRE) allows distributed components (i.e., servers, legacy systems, databases, COTs, printers, scanners, etc.) to be treated akin to OS resources, where each component (resource) can publish services (an API), that are then available for use by clients and resources alike. DREs have lagged in support of security. To address this deficiency, this paper concentrates on proposing a technique for seamlessly integrating a role-based security model, authorization, authentication, and enforcement into a DRE, including our prototyping with the JINI DRE.</p>
