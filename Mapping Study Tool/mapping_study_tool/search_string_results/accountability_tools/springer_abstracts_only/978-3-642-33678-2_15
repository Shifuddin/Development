                          <p class="Para">Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a widely used dependability and safety technique aiming at systematically identifying failure modes, their generating causes and their effects on the system.</p>
                          <p class="Para">While FMEA has been mainly thought for hardware systems, its use is also advocated for software (SW-FMEA). This involves several major challenges, such as the complexity of functional requirements, the difficulty to identify failure modes of SW components, the elusive nature of faults.</p>
                          <p class="Para">We present an approach for efficient and effective manipulation of data involved in the SW-FMEA process, introducing an ontological model which formalizes concepts involved in the analysis. The methodology provides a common conceptual framework supporting cohesion across different stages of a development life-cycle, giving a precise semantics to concepts collected in the artifacts of an industrial documentation process.</p>
                          <p class="Para">This also opens the way to the implementation of a tool, built on top of a stack of semantic web technologies, for automating the SW-FMEA process. Results of the application of the methodology and the tool to a real scenario, in which activities and documents are regulated by well-established standards, are reported. The experience proves the suitability and the practical effectiveness of the approach, showing improvements on SW-FMEA practices.</p>
