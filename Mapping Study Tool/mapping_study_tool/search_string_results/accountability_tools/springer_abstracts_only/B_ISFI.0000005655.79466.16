                          <p class="Para">Orthopaedic oncology is highly dependent on imaging studies to diagnose and treat patients. However, many types of bone tumors are rare creating a lack of teaching and research cases. We have developed a system to locally document and nationally register electronic images for teaching and research on bone tumors. The system minimizes storage requirements and maintains confidentiality using a unique approach. This paper demonstrates the system design and current implementation.</p>
