                          <p class="Para">Many organizations and industries continuously struggle to achieve a foundation of a sound verification and validation process. Because verification and validation is only marginally addressed in software process improvement models like CMMI, a separate verification and validation improvement model has been developed. The framework of the improvement model presented in this paper is based on the â€œTesting Maturity Model (TMM). However considerable enhancements are provided, such as a V&amp;V assessment procedure and a detailed metrics program to determine effectiveness and efficiency of the improvements. This paper addresses the development approach of MB-V2M2, an outline of the model, early validation experiments, current status and future outlook. The resulting model is dubbed MB- V2M2 (Metrics Based Verification&amp;Validation Maturity Model).</p>
