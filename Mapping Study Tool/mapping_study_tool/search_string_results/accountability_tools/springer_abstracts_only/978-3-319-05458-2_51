                          <p class="Para">In Europe there are a lot of transportation and logistics companies. They provide different services, depending on their sizes and scope. The largest logistics service providers use advanced ICT solutions enabling them to capture, transform and interchange data. However, others, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), do not have enough money to invest in new ICT solutions which allow to monitor data e.g. related to the inbound freight flows.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, the authors propose a solution which is based on cloud community and e-cluster. It gives SMEs a better possibility to automatically capture information and exchange it within a particular enterprisesâ€™ network. Also, it helps to build up business relations and, finally, to better match demand and supply capacity data. The main idea of the project and the proposal to optimize business operations in the context of the usage of cloud computing facilities are presented.</p>
