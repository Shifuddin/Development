                          <p class="Para">Security is a critical issue in mobile radio applications both forthe users and providers of such systems. Although the same may besaid of all communications systems, mobile application havespecial requirements and vulnerabilities, and are therefore ofspecial concern. Emerging wireless networks share many commoncharacteristics with traditional wire-line networks such as publicswitch telephone/data networks, and hence many security issueswith the wire-line networks also apply to the wirelessenvironment. However the integration of security features intowireless communication must take into account restrictions thatmay apply to their use such as small packet size, low bandwidth,high transmission costs, limited processing and storage resourcesand real time constraints. In this paper security requirements inwireless communications along with security features in 2G and 3Gsystems are described.</p>
