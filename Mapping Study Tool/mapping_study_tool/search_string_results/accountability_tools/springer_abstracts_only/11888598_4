                        <p class="Para">The importance of context-aware information and services delivery is becoming increasingly recognised. Delivering information and services to AEC/FM (architecture, engineering and construction/facilities management) personnel, based on their context (e.g. location, time, profile etc) has tremendous potential to improve working practices, particularly with respect to productivity and safety, by providing intelligent context-specific support to them. This paper discusses a vision of context-aware service delivery within the AEC/FM sector and presents three case studies to illustrate the concepts. It starts with a brief overview of context-aware computing and a system architecture which facilitates context capture, context brokerage and integration with legacy applications. This is followed by presentation of case-studies that relate to actual deployments on a simulated construction site, in a construction education environment and in a train station. The deployment process and findings from each of the case studies are summarised and the benefits highlighted. Conclusions are drawn about the possible future impact of context-aware applications in AEC/FM.</p>
