                          <p class="Para">Political terrorism and insurgency have become the primary means of global war among states. Lacking comparable military and political means to compete directly with Western civilization, many failed states and tribes have honed the art of asymmetric warfare. But traditional models of organizations do not work under normal or these extreme circumstances, precluding realistic models of terrorism and a fruitful search among alternatives for potential solutions. In contrast to traditional models, we have made substantial progress with a quantum model of organizations, which we further develop in this study with the introduction of a case study of a normal organization in the process of being restructured. We apply preliminary results from our model to terrorist organizations and counter terrorism.</p>
