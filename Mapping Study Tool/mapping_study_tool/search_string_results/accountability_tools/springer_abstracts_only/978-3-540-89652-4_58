                        <p class="Para">The flourish of SaaS brings about a pressing requirement for Multi-tenancy to avoid dedicated installation for each tenant and benefit from reduced service delivery costs. Multi-tenancy’s intention is to satisfy requests from different tenants concurrently by a single service instance over shared hosting resources. However, extensive resource sharing easily causes inter-tenant performance interference. Therefore, Performance isolation is crucial for Multi-tenancy environment to prevent the potentially bad behaviors of one tenant from adversely affecting the performance of others in an unpredictable manner and prevent the unbalanced situation where some tenants achieve very high performance at the cost of others. Current technologies fail to achieve the goals of both performance isolation and resource share. This paper proposes a Service Performance Isolation Infrastructure (SPIN) which allows extensive resource sharing on hosting systems. Once some aggressive tenants interfere with others’ performance, SPIN gives anomaly report, identifies the aggressive tenants, and enables a self-adaptive moderation to remove their negative impacts on others. We have implemented SPIN prototype and demonstrate its isolation efficiency on the Trade6 benchmark which is revised to support Multi-tenancy. SPIN fits industry practice for a performance overhead less than 5%.</p>
