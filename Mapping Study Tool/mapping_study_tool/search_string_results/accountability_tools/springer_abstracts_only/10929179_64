                          <p class="Para">This paper considers the effectiveness of the UK’s geographic information network in developing a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). It argues that despite domain expertise and considerable consensus the network has failed to establish a vision for an SDI at the heart of the UK’s e-government strategy, a failure that may be impacting on that strategy. The paper concludes that European organisations may become significant actors in the network.</p>
