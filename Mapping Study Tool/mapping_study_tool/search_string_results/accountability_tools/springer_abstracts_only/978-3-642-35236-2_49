                          <p class="Para">Telecommunication network infrastructures such as cables, satellites, and cellular towers, play an important role in maintaining the stability of society worldwide. The protection of these critical infrastructures and their supporting structure become highly challenged to both public and private organizations. The understanding of interdependency of these infrastructures is the essential step to protect these infrastructures. This paper presents a critical infrastructure detection model to discover the interdependency based on the model from social network and new telecommunication pathways, while this study focuses on social theory into computational constructs. The policy and procedure of protecting critical infrastructures are discussed, and computational results from the proposed model are presented.</p>
