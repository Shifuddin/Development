                          <p class="Para">This paper proposes that accountability in electronic processes is enhanced by sharing certified event data between the participants. Enhancing transparency of processes allows those with the contextual information to understand the process and interactions to spot mistakes or fraud that others may miss. Enabling the sharing of this information makes accountability more interactive and allows for both a more intelligent and faster response to problems. This paper describes an evidence store that supports this level of interactivity thereby enabling interactive and intelligent accountability.</p>
