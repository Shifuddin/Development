However, developing the IT Industry, and ensuring that practitioners are professional, will provide an industry that can create wealth. After a brief discussion on what is meant by professionalism, this paper will explore the issues relating to IT in Africa, especially South Africa, and why Africa is the “forgotten continent” from a global IT perspective. It explores professionalism skills frameworks, and how proven skills levels can help change this perspective. Finally, it provides recommendations for a way forward.</p>
