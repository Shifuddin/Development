                        <p class="Para">We consider a decentralized setting in which agents exchange data along with usage policies. Agents may violate the intended usage policies, although later on auditing authorities may verify the agentsâ€™ data accountability with respect to the intended policies. Using time-stamping and signature schemes, we design and analyze an efficient cryptographic protocol generating communication evidences, in such a way that an agent is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">accountable</em> in our protocol only if the agent behaved honestly.</p>
