                          <p class="Para">Information systems design must balance requirements of privacy and accountability for the good of individuals and society. Drawing from an evolving theory of scrutiny, we propose a multi-layer protocol to support the rigorous application of privacy rules and accountability rules in sensitive online applications. We ground our study in the context of the design and development of an eHealth system for psychosocial care. Privacy protections are balanced with the need to provide for accountable interventions in well-defined critical care situations.</p>
