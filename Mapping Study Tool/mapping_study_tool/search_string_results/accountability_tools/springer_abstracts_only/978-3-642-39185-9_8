                        <p class="Para">We describe in detail dispute resolution problems with cryptographic voting systems that do not produce a paper record of the unencrypted vote. With these in mind, we describe the design and use of Audiotegrityâ€”a cryptographic voting protocol and corresponding voting system with some of the accessibility benefits of fully-electronic voting systems and some of the dispute resolution properties of paper-ballot-based systems. We also describe subtle issues with coercion-resistance if accessible systems are not well-designed.</p>
                        <p class="Para">Audiotegrity was designed in response to a request by Takoma Park election officials, tested in a public test organized by the city in June 2011, and used in its municipal election in November 2011. We are not aware of any other precinct-based end-to-end independently-verifiable election for public office where the protocol enabled participation by voters with visual disabilities.</p>
