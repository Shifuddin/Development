                          <p class="Para">We propose a biological approach to information security based on a rigorous mathematical notion of formal immune network. According to our previous developments, such networks possess all the main capabilities of artificial intelligence system, and could be considered as an alternative to the wide spread artificial neural networks or intelligent agents. We consider also the main distinctions of our approach from the modern information security by agent-based modeling and artificial immune systems.</p>
