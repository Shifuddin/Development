                          <p class="Para">P2P networks provide a basic form of anonymity, and the participating nodes exchange information without knowing who is the original sender. Packets are relayed through the adjacent nodes and do not contain identity information about the sender. Since these packets are passed through a dynamically-formed path and since the final destination is not known until the last time, it is impossible to know who has sent it in the beginning and who will be the final recipient. The anonymity, however, breaks down at download/upload time because the IP address of the host from which the data is downloaded (or to which it is uploaded) can be known to the outside. We propose a technique to provide anonymity for both the client and the server node. A random node along the path between the client and the server node is selected as an agent node and works as a proxy: the client will see it as the server and the server looks at it as the client, hence protecting the identity of the client and the server from anonymity-breaking attacks.</p>
