                        <p class="Para">Whereas the R&amp;D process of convergence of knowledge and technology has been largely reactive or coincidental in the past, there is a growing realization among the world’s scientific communities that to take best advantage of scientific innovation trends and govern them appropriately, there must be a more proactive, focused effort to support convergence, and that investments in innovative technology development must more effectively both engage and benefit society and also take into consideration equity and sustainability concerns. This chapter describes a framework and means to effectively focus societal support for convergence. A “science of convergence” will help to accomplish these goals and promote valuable technological and societal synergies based on higher-level scientific languages, a holistic view of society, updated governance models, and vision-inspired basic research that is geared to societal benefit. Creativity and innovation are enhanced by the circuit of information and ideas between various platforms of the human activity system. As exchanges happen faster and between larger domains within the platforms, the foundation for creativity, innovation, and economic and societal benefit broadens. This is a global phenomenon.</p>
