                          <p class="Para">The proliferation of sensing devices create plethora of data-streams, which in turn can be harnessed to carry out sophisticated analytics to support various real-time applications and services as well as long-term planning, e.g., in the context of intelligent cities or smart homes. A mature cloud infrastructure brings such a vision closer to reality than ever before, as more and more data owners are moving their data to the cloud. Hence, the ability to flexibly and easily control the granularity at which they share their data with other entities become more important. It makes data owners feel comfortable to share to start with, and also provide them a platform to realize different business models or logics. In this paper, we explore some basic operations to flexibly control the access on a data-stream and propose a framework <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">eXACML+</em> that extends the standard XACML model to achieve the same. We develop a prototype using the commercial StreamBase engine to demonstrate a seamless combination of stream data processing with (a small but important selected set of) fine-grained access control mechanisms, and to evaluate the frameworkâ€™s efficacy based on experiments in cloud like environments.</p>
