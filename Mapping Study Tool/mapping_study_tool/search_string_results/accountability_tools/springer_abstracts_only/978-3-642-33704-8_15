                          <p class="Para">This paper addresses security information management in complex application scenarios. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems collect and examine security related events, with the goal of providing a unified view of the monitored systemsâ€™ security status. While various SIEMs are in production, there is scope to extend the capability and resilience of these systems. The use of SIEM technology in four disparate scenario areas is used in this paper as a catalyst for the development and articulation of Security and Reliability requirements for advanced security event management. The scenarios relate to infrastructure management for a large real-time sporting event, a mobile money payment system, a managed services environment and a cyber-physical dam control system. The diversity of the scenarios enables elaboration of a comprehensive set of Security and Reliability requirements which can be used in the development of future SIEM systems.</p>
