It outlines the original goals of the German funded project to provide a seamless batch interface for German HPC centers and its evolution toward a Grid Computing Environment. The focus is on technical results, like abstraction to achieve seamlessness and use of certificates for authentication and security. The rationale behind technical decisions will be provided and the future role of UNICORE will be presented.</p>
