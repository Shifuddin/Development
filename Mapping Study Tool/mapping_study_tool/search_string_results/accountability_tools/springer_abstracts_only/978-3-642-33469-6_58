                          <p class="Para">SARA algorithm is a self-adaptive wireless sensor network (WSN) routing algorithm. It can, depending on the parameter values, select a different network performance metrics for path selection. SARA algorithm takes three performance indicators into account: network life cycle, network delay, network reliability .By adjusting the proportion of each of the three performance indicators, SARA is able to fulfill the network requirements of a longer life cycle, shorter delay network and a higher reliability. In this paper, an experimental study of the SARA life is conducted and an energy model is formulated in order to prove the efficiency of the network performance. Furthermore, the established energy model proves the energy performance of SARA and its superiority in energy consumption by laboratory analysis, compared with LEACH algorithm.</p>
