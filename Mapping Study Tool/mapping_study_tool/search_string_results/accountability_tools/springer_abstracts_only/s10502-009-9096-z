He suggests that what could be called the conditions of postmodernity have challenged the insularity of these discourses in profound ways, and argues that they have been enriched by engagement with other disciplines, professions and traditions.

His illustrative reading focuses on that space we call ‘the secret’, offering a preliminary exploration of the psychologies and the politics of secrecy.</p>
