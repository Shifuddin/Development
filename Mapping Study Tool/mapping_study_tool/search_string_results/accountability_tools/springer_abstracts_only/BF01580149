                          <p class="Para">We describe how aircraft are designed in a large organization. We discuss the different phases of design and interaction with the customer. We then describe the models used by each specialist department and the interactions among departments during the design process. We observe that the main design choices are refinement operations on the design. We then briefly describe how the negotiation process is controlled by an organizationally agreed sequence of commitment steps. We then describe negotiation at higher levels in the organization. What decisions are made, the compromises worked out, and the effect of these higher-level commitments on the design process.</p>
                          <p class="Para">We conclude that: (1) aircraft design proceeds by the<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cooperation</em> of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">specialists</em> (specialist teams or departments); (2) each specialist has its own<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">model</em> of the design, and may use several different models or partial models for different purposes; (3) specialists have limited ability to understand each other's models. They communicate using a<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">shared vocabulary,</em> but not necessarily shared technical knowledge; (4) design proceeds by successive<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">refinement</em> of the models, which are coordinated and updated together; (5) the design decisions, which are acts of commitment and model refinement, are<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">negotiated</em> by the specialists among themselves; (6) one way this negotiation process is organized and controlled is by the use of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">commitment steps;</em> (7) negotiations occur at higher levels in the organization, resulting in commitments which greatly influence and constrain the design process and its organization, and which have the greatest effect on the cost of the product.</p>
