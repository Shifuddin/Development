                            <p class="Para">The Glossary of Terms and Definitions captures a shared multidisciplinary understanding within the EU FP7 Cloud Accountability Project (A4Cloud). It consists of the key terms that have been identified by the A4Cloud’s Accountability Conceptual Framework. The definitions in the glossary have been drawn from relevant research literature, standards or domain specific references (e.g. data protection, cloud computing, information security, privacy, etc.). The A4Cloud’s Accountability Conceptual Framework has proposed (or revised) definitions of those terms that are central to concept of accountability (and related attributes). The glossary is the result of a collaborative effort of the A4Cloud project. The final glossary consists of over 150 terms (drawn from an initial list of over 700 terms) selected for their relevance to accountability. It consists of the core accountability terms that have been defined and used across the A4Cloud project.</p>
