                      <p class="Para">While it is commendable that the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (‘PDPA’) was finally passed by the Malaysian parliament after a long wait of a decade, the PDPA has received several criticisms due to its peculiar limitations. This chapter addresses many of these limitations and draws comparative analysis with data protection law in other jurisdictions. In addition to the PDPA, there are also several sectoral rules and regulations which specifically govern processing of personal data in certain sectors such as the banking and financial institutions sectors, healthcare sector, insurance sector, telecommunications and multimedia sectors. The Malaysian Parliament also passed the Credit Reporting Agencies Act 2010 to govern the processing of credit information by credit reporting agency in Malaysia. The author examines the relevant rules and regulations in these respective sectors.</p>
