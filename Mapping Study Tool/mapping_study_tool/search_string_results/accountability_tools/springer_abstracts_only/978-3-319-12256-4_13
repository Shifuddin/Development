                          <p class="Para">A large and rapidly growing number of laws is impacting software systems world-wide. For each one of them, software designers need to ensure that their system, new or legacy, complies with the law. Establishing compliance requires the ability to identify which laws are applicable, what are the different ways to comply, and whether given requirements for a software system comply. In this short paper we give an overview of ongoing work on Nòmos 3, a modelling language tailored to modelling laws and requirements. Nòmos 3 models can be translated into a formal specification that supports automated compliance analysis.</p>
