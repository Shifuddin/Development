                        <p class="Para">The mobile agent systems have been well known for years, but recent developments in the mobile technology (mobile phones, middleware) and the artificial intelligence created new research directions. Currently being widely used for the e-commerce and network management are entering into more personal areas of our life, e.g., booking airline tickets, doing shopping, making an appointment at the dentist. Future agents are becoming more like our representatives in the Internet than simple software. To operate efficiently in their new role they need to have the same capabilities as we do, showing their credentials when required and being anonymous when needed. Still they have to fulfill all security requirements for agent systems, including confidentiality, integrity, accountability, and availability. This paper focuses on providing mobile agents with anonymity and privacy. The proposed schemes are based on different cryptographic primitives: the secret sharing scheme and the zero-knowledge proof. The paper also includes a discussion of security of the proposed schemes.</p>
