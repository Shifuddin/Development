                          <p class="Para">Task complexity has been recognized as one of the most important determinants of human behavior and task performance. This paper reviews the relationship between task complexity and task performance. Influencing mechanism of task complexity is tentatively explored. Then, a conceptual framework is proposed to present the possible relationships among task complexity, task difficulty, self-efficacy, task characteristics, task performer characteristics, and task performance, for the sake of sharing and generalizing scientific findings across different areas.</p>
