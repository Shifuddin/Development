                          <p class="Para">Flocks is a privacy-enhancing technology (PET) used to hide the web usage patterns of employees in an organization against profiling or mere inspection by administrators and other officials. However, Flocks is intended to support the identification of senders of malicious requests by means of a legitimate forensic investigation.</p>
                          <p class="Para">This paper formalizes what should be logged for an appropriate forensic investigation. Also, it considers exactly what evidence should be explored once a malicious request has been noticed. It argues that (i) evidence that would have been collected about a malicious request if the PET were not used, should still be collected, and (ii) evidence that becomes visible by some legitimate means because the PET is used, should be collected. However, information that has not become visible by such legitimate means, but is available because the PET is being used, should not be collected. In the latter case, privacy concerns override the fact that a malicious request might be uncovered by investigating more logged information. These positions are defended and formalized using mathematical notation.</p>
