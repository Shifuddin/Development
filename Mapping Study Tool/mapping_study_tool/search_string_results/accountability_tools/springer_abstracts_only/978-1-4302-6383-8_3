                        <p class="Para">Every organization or enterprise exists to achieve its objectives, both business objectives and social objectives. Its existence or continued existence is of no use unless it is able to achieve its objectives. For the continued existence of any organization, information security has become a non-negotiable necessity. However, the acceptability for information security is very low in an organization because of its arbitrary implementation. Information security will be appreciated by everybody if the same structure is implemented, keeping in mind an organization’s business objectives and business requirements. Furthermore, information technology has to enable information security which, in turn, will protect its business, customers, partners, and systems, such as its people, infrastructure (including its networks), and applications. This in turn means that all the strategies of the organization – business strategies, IT strategies, and information security strategies – have to complement each other and are to be balanced.</p>
