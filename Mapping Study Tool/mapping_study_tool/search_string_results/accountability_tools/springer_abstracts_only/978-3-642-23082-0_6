                          <p class="Para">The Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) management process for Information Security is a necessity for any software systems where important information is collected, processed, and used. To this extent, many standards for security managements at operational level exists (e.g., ITIL, ISO27K family etc). What is often missing is a process to govern security at organizational level.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this tutorial, we present a method to analyze and design security controls that capture the organizational setting of the system and where business goals and processes are the main citizen. The SI*-GRC method is a comprehensive method that is composed of i) a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">modeling framework</em> based on a requirement engineering framework, with some extensions related to security &amp; GRC concerns, such as: trust, permission, risk, and treatment, 2) a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">analysis process</em> defining systematical steps in analyzing and design security controls, 3) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">analytical techniques</em> to verify that certain security properties are satisfied and the risk level is acceptable, and at last 4) a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">CASE tool</em>, namely the SI* Tool to support analysts in using the method.</p>
                          <p class="Para">To illustrate this method, we use a running example on e-Health adapted from a real-life process in an hospital partner.</p>
