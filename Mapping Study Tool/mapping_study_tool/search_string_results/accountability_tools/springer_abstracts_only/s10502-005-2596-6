                          <p class="Para">This paper reports on the research design and methods used to investigate the interactions of organisational culture, defined as encompassing layers of national, occupational and corporate culture, with information and its management. A central focus of the study was recordkeeping in organisations. Consideration is given to the key concepts involved, and the two theoretical frameworks which were used as analytical tools in the study are outlined – the information continuum model and Hofstede’s dimensions of national culture. Use of a case study methodology, analysis of the data collected and comparative analysis of findings are all discussed.</p>
