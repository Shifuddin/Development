                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we describe SuperTrust, a novel framework designed to handle trust relationships in Super peer networks. What distinguishes SuperTrust from other contributions is that trust reports remain <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">encrypted</em> and are never opened during the submission or aggregation processes, thus guaranteeing privacy and anonymity of transactions. As reputations of peers influence their future interactions, we argue that such systems must have properties like fairness and soundness, persistence, eligibility and unreusability of reports, similar to the properties of current electronic voting systems.</p>
                          <p class="Para">SuperTrust is a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">decentralized</em> protocol, based on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>-redundant Super peer networks, that guarantees the aforementioned properties and is in some sense complementary to the models proposed for building trust among peers. Additionally the framework is very efficient and minimizes the effects of collusion of malicious Super peers/aggregators. We have tested the framework on a large subset of peers and demonstrated via simulations its superior performance when compared to the other proposed protocols.</p>
