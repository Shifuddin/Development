                          <p class="Para">Over the last decade governments of many developing nations have undertaken initiatives to adopt e-Government. There is evidence that these nations faced many challenges during the phase of implementation. The aim of this research is to investigate the critical determinants associated with the implementation of e-Government in Bangladesh. The results indicate that currently there exist a high degree of political commitment and administrative leadership. What is required is to improve skills of the human resources within the implementing agencies, and to develop awareness of both public agencies and general citizens. The results also highlight that the implementing agencies must develop right organisational structures and formulate appropriate regulatory framework. Previous studies on e-Government predominantly used case studies and qualitative approaches. This is one of the rare studies which applied a quantitative method using data from four categories of stakeholders. The findings of the research can be applied in many developing nations.</p>
