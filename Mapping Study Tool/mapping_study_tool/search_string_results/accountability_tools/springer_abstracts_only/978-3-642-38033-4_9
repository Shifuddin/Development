                          <p class="Para">Sanitizable signature (SS) allows a signer to partly delegate signing rights to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a predetermined</em> party, called sanitizer, who can later modify certain designated parts of a message originally signed by the signer and generate a new signature on the sanitized message without interacting with the signer. One of the important security requirements of sanitizable signatures is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">accountability</em>, which allows the signer to prove, in case of dispute, to a third party that a message was modified by the sanitizer. Trapdoor sanitizable signature (TSS) enables a signer of a message to delegate the power of sanitization to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">any parties at anytime</em> but at the expense of losing the accountability property. In this paper, we introduce the notion of accountable trapdoor sanitizable signature (ATSS) which lies between SS and TSS. As a building block for constructing ATSS, we also introduce the notion of accountable chameleon hash (ACH), which is an extension of chameleon hash (CH) and might be of independent interest. We propose a concrete construction of ACH and show how to use it to construct an ATSS scheme.</p>
