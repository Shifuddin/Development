                            <p class="Para">We have performed penetration testing on OPC, which is a central component in process control systems on oil installations. We have shown how a malicious user with different privileges – outside the network, access to the signalling path and physical access to the OPC server – can fairly easily compromise the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the system. Our tentative tests demonstrate that full-scale penetration testing of process control systems in offshore installations is necessary in order to sensitise the oil and gas industry to the evolving threats.</p>
