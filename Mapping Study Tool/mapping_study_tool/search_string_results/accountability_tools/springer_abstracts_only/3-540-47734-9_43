                          <p class="Para">TINA (Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture) concepts and principles are introduced with the objective of correcting problems of centralized service control and service data model existing in IN (Intelligent Network). Now, TINA has been designed with the goal to offer an universal vision of telecommunications services, it answers to the increasing needs of fast developments of news services e.g., multimedia, multi-party conferencing, etc., will need to be rapidly and efficiently introduced, deployed, operated and managed. In this context, TINA developed a comprehensive architecture for multi-service networks that support multimedia service. On the other hand, the provisioning of all the service management context functionality for TINA services (i.e. FCAPS) is still an open research question.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we discuss accounting features and requirements, security services for TINA management context. We propose and implement a model of accouniting and security management middleware architecture. A prototype uses the environment CORBA object and JAVA to validate the concepts.</p>
