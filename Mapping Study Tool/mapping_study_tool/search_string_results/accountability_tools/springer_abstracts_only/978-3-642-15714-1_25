                          <p class="Para">The lack of communication channels and support information can make the critical search and rescue of survivors after a disaster an ineffective process resulting in losses. This work addresses this problem by proposing a simple and portable command post application based on mobile devices and ad-hoc networks. The application provides support to communication and collaboration aiming to speed up the SAR process. The system architecture and some implementation issues are also presented.</p>
