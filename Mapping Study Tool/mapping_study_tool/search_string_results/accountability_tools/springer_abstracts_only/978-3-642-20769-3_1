                          <p class="Para">This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to privacy. The subject is examined from an ethical, social, and economic perspective reflecting the preliminary findings of the EU-funded research project PRESCIENT. The analysis will give a comprehensive illustration of the dimensionsâ€™ unique and characteristic features. This will build the basis for identifying overlaps and developing synergetic effects, which should ideally contribute to a better understanding of privacy.</p>
