                          <p class="Para">The security requirements of complex multi-tier web applications have shifted from simple localized needs, such as authentication or authorization, to physically distributed but actually aggregated services, such as end-to-end data protection, non-repudiation or patient consent management. Currently, there is no support for integrating complex security services in web architectures, nor are approaches from other architectural models easily portable. In this paper we present the architecture of a security middleware, aimed at providing a reusable solution bringing support for complex security requirements into the application architecture, while addressing typical web architecture challenges, such as the tiered model or the lack of sophisticated client-side logic. We both evaluate the security of the middleware and present a case study and prototype implementation, which show how the complexities of a web architecture can be dealt with while limiting the integration effort.</p>
