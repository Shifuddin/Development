                          <p class="Para">Ubicomp (Ubiquitous Computing) makes computers ubiquitous in anywhere and anytime, and so provides users with seamless services. In this paper, we present a user location privacy protection mechanism for Smart Space which is a feasible Ubicomp environment. At first, we present a feasible Ubicomp use scenario and define Smart Space to support this derived scenario. Then, we analyze security requirements for Smart Space and derive conceptual security model for that Space. Among the conceptual security model, we focus on user location privacy protection. In order to protect user location privacy, we propose a location privacy protection mechanism based on policy. We classify the policy as user policy and space policy and present policy resolution mechanism to resolve policy conflicts. Further we present system configuration to execute the proposed mechanism.</p>
