                          <p class="Para">Given the difficulties and criticality of information sharing in a multi-agency setting, this paper looks at the IT governance mechanisms used to promote information sharing via shared boundary objects in the disaster response and recovery process. A longitudinal, descriptive case study relates the experiences of a community of disaster recovery stakeholders from a coastal region as they work together to share digital geospatial data on the communityâ€™s physical utility infrastructure. Previous research is affirmed and extended in four empirically grounded research propositions addressing the nature of shared boundary objects, multi-agency governance, multi-agency performance metrics, and governance alignment. No exact governance configuration is deemed superior (except maybe avoidance of anarchy); however, there is a strong tendency not only to centralize, but also to retain localized control.</p>
