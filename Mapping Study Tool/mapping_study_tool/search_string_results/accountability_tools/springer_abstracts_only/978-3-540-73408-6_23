                        <p class="Para">The recent development of location-based services has originated a set of new security services that address their particular security problems. Spatial-temporal certification services are among these new services. They have as main goal the generation of evidences about an entityâ€™s spatial-temporal information and, in general, their life-cycle support. Currently there is still a lack of a general framework for spatial-temporal certification services. In this work it is presented such a framework and an extension of the X.509 attribute certificate framework and the SAML standard to represent spatial-temporal certificates.</p>
