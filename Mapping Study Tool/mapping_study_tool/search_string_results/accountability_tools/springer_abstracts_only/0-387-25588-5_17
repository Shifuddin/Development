                          <p class="Para">This paper provides instructors of computing a method to integrate computing history in the computing curriculum and to elevate the awareness of the social context of the subject. It provides suggestions by which instructors can enrich the curriculum by including history in the subjects they teach, even though they may not have had formal education in computing history or the history of science. Using history in computing very often stimulates discussion and dialogue among students and makes them aware of the social consequences of the computer systems they will use, help design, or create. Instructors can enrich the courses they now teach by integrating social and historical interludes within them.</p>
