                          <p class="Para">In this paper we examine an emerging class of systems that link <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>eople-to-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>eople-to-Geographical-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P</em>laces; we call these <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P3-Systems</em>. Through analyzing the literature, we have identified four major P3-System design techniques: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">People-Centered</em> systems that use either <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">absolute user location</em> (e.g. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Active Badge</em>) or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">user proximity</em> (e.g. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Hocman</em>) and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Place-Centered</em> systems based on either a representation of peopleâ€™s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">use of physical spaces</em> (e.g. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ActiveMap</em>) or on a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">matching virtual space</em> that enables online interaction linked to physical location (e.g. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Geonotes</em>). In addition, each feature can be instantiated synchronously or asynchronously. The P3-System framework organizes existing systems into meaningful categories and structures the design space for an interesting new class of potentially context-aware systems. Our discussion of the framework suggests new ways of understanding and addressing the privacy concerns associated with location aware community system and outlines additional socio-technical challenges and opportunities.</p>
