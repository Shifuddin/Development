                          <p class="Para">In the contract-signing problem, participants wish to sign a contract <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">m</em> in such a way that either all participants obtain each othersâ€™ signatures, or nobody does. A contract-signing protocol is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">optimistic</em> if it relies on a trusted third party, but only uses it when participants misbehave (e.g., try to cheat, or simply crash).</p>
                          <p class="Para">We construct an efficient general multi-party optimistic contract-singing protocol. The protocol is also <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">abuse-free</em>, meaning that at no point can a participant prove to others that he is capable of choosing whether to validate or invalidate the contract. This is the first abuse-free optimistic contract-signing protocol that has been developed for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> &gt; 3 parties. We also show a linear lower bound on the number of rounds of any n-party optimistic contract-signing protocol.</p>
