                          <p class="Para">This paper proposes a novel approach based on the honeybee model to improve the intrusion detection system. The power of defending the intruder from entering the hive, the effectiveness of exchanging information between the bees and the successfulness of other existing AI approaches that honey bee can be efficiently compared to, have lead us towards analyzing a new area in honeybee concerning security. Most existing systems only detect general and known attacks. Therefore a lot of malicious attacks intrude without any detection. We demonstrate the methods that use HoneybeeGuard in filtration and classification; “undesirable–absent” and “desirable–present”, to identify a malicious packet, and detect the known and unknown intruders.</p>
