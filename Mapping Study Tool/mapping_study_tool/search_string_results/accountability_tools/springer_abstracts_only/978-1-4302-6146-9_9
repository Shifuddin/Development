                      <p class="Para">In this chapter we'll see how the concepts covered individually in the previous chapters relate to each other. We have been looking at the many concepts and components of the technology solutions needed to enable the trusted infrastructure that moves us toward the goal of delivering trusted clouds. We have covered the foundational elements of platform trust attestation, network virtualization security, and identity management in the cloud. In this chapter, we put all these elements together. Virtustream, a key Intel partner, took a proof of concept implementation, originally developed with Intel, for a key customer and evolved it into a new capability to enable <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">secure cloud bursting</em> that is available to all Virtustream customers. We'll explain the nature of this new capability and examine the architecture and reference design for this capability in the next few pages.</p>
