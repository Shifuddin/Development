                        <p class="Para">This chapter addresses the question of how to generate concrete architectures with the IoT ARM, which is one of the many uses to which an architectural reference model can be put (see <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40403-0_3"><span class="RefSource">Chaps.​ 3</span></a></span> and <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40403-0_4"><span class="RefSource">4</span></a></span>). This topic was already touched upon in Section “Generation of Architectures” in <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40403-0_3"><span class="RefSource">Chap.​ 3</span></a></span>, but it is covered in greater depth in this section.</p>
