                          <p class="Para">Nowadays, interoperability of DRM is an issue in market. It can be achieved by three different approaches: full-format, configuration-driven and connected interoperability. In particular, the connected interoperability refers to devices that contact an online translation service. When the consumers want to transfer content to a different device, they access the online translation server and rely upon online services. The connected interoperability does not need defining one standard and has the ability to monitor. Therefore, the connected interoperability is used more than others in market. However, in the connected interoperability, even though two distinct DRM systems want to share the content, they cannot share the content if the online translation server does not guarantee reliability. In this paper, we propose a protection profile for connected interoperable DRM framework to solve the problem. This PP can be used to establish trust between the DRM provider and the online translation server for interoperability. If that happens, the connected interoperable DRM market will be more active than before.</p>
