                        <p class="Para">SPI paradigm is dominated by improvement based on quantitative process metrics. The assumption behind this research is that improvement should be based, not just on insight in quantitative data about development processes, but also on insight in how developers think about system development: Software is developed by people, and it is the developersâ€™ perceptions, experience and thinking about system development that guides their behavior. The present research develops an approach based on causal maps and counterfactual thinking that supports developers in learning from individual system development projects. The research adds to the body of knowledge concerning management and learning in system development practice.</p>
