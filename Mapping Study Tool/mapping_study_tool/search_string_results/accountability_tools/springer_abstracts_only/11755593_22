                          <p class="Para">Without trust, pervasive devices cannot collaborate effectively, and without collaboration, the pervasive computing vision cannot be made a reality. Distributed trust frameworks may support trust and thus foster collaboration in an hostile pervasive computing environment. Existing frameworks deal with foundational properties of computational trust. We here propose a distributed trust framework that satisfies a broader range of properties. Our framework: (i) evolves trust based on a Bayesian formalization, whose trust metric is expressive, yet tractable; (ii) is lightweight; (iii) protects user anonymity, whilst being resistant to “Sybil attacks” (and enhancing detection of two collusion attacks); (iv) integrates a risk-aware decision module. We evaluate the framework through four experiments.</p>
