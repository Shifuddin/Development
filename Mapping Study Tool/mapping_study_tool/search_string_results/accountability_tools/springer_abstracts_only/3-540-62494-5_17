                        <p class="Para">In this paper, we consider the security management of a residential ATM network, the ATM Warren. Threats within the ATM Warren are presented and counter-measures to some of these threats are suggested. Security issues in the ATM Warren such as protection domain, naming, firewalling and delegation are also discussed. We also propose user authentication mechanism based on infra-red remote control. Finally, we demonstrate an efficient data path protection mechanism that is able to handle dumb ATM end devices.</p>
