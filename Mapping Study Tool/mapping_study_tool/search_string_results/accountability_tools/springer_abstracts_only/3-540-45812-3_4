                          <p class="Para">This paper proposes a concept to apply modeling tools to Multi-Provider Telematics Service Management. The service architecture is based on the framework called “Open Service Components” which serves as building blocks to compose end-to-end telematics services in terms of service components offered by different service providers. Our work presented in this paper contributes to the abstract way of modeling end-to-end Service Management using Architectural Description Language and an underlying Formal Description Language.</p>
