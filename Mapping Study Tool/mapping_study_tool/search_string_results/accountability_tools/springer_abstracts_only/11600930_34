                        <p class="Para">The Common Electronic Purse Specifications (CEPS) define requirements for all components needed by an organization to implement a globally interoperable electronic purse program. In this paper we describe how we model purchase transaction protcol in CEPS using formal specification language. We define and verify the money accountability property of the CEPS, and we address its violation scenario in the presence of communication network failures. Using model checking technique we find that transaction record stored in the trusted-third party plays a essential role in satisfying the accountability property.</p>
