                          <p class="Para">This paper describes a secure role based messaging system design based on the use of X.509 Attribute Certificates for holding user roles. Access to the messages is authorised by the PERMIS Privilege Management Infrastructure, a policy driven role based access control (RBAC) infrastructure, which allows the assignment of roles to be distributed between trusted issuing authorities, and allows a change of access control policy at runtime. Messages can be sent by roles and users, and can be sent to roles and users. Messages are secure in their exchange between senders and recipients. Details of the security and messaging design are presented.</p>
