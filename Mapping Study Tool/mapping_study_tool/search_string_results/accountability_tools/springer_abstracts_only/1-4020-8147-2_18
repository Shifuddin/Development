                          <p class="Para">Ring signatures are an important primitive for protecting signersâ€™ privacy while ensuring that a signature in question is indeed issued by some qualified user. This notion can be seen as a generalization of the well-known notion of group signatures. A group signature is a signature such that a verifier can establish its validity but not the identity of the actual signer, who can nevertheless be identified by a designated entity called group manager. A ring signature is also a signature such that a verifier can establish its validity but not the identity of the actual signer, who indeed can <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">never</em> be identified by any party. An important advantage of ring signatures over group signatures is that there is no need to pre-specify rings or groups of users.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we argue that the lack of an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">accountability</em> mechanism in ring signature schemes would result in severe consequences, and thus accountable ring signatures might be very useful. An accountable ring signature ensures the following: anyone can verify that the signature is generated by a user belonging to a set of possible signers that may be chosen on-the-fly, whereas the actual signer can nevertheless be identified by a designated trusted entity - a system-wide participant independent of any possible ring of users. Further, we present a system framework for accountable ring signatures. The framework is based on a compiler that transforms a traditional ring signature scheme into an accountable one. We also conduct a case study by elaborating on how a traditional ring signature scheme is transformed into an accountable one while assuming a weak trust model.</p>
