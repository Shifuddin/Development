                          <p class="Para">The recently proposed intermediation schemes in e-government are meant to speed up and facilitate integration and access to services offered by local and regional public sector service providers. They should provide end-users with ubiquitous e-government services, in the sense of adapting to citizens/businesses location, context, channel, language or skills and, what is more, take care for the seamless (i.e. transparent to end-users) integration of cross-organisational services. In this paper we present e-government intermediation requirements.</p>
