                          <p class="Para">Networked organizations have an increasing importance today. As the basic characteristic of these systems is the communication and cooperation via networks, the new networking technologies influence the operation parameters, possibilities of the cooperation and the production itself in the networked organization as well. The paper introduces shortly the main characteristics of the different types of communication networks and gives a short survey on the impacts of novel networking technologies on work processes, security policy/strategy, organization structure, cooperation policy, human resource behavior/education (role of trust) of networked enterprises as well.</p>
