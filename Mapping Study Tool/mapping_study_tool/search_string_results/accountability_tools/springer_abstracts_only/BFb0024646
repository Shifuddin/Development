                        <p class="Para">Formal methods may be at the crossroads of acceptance by a wider industrial community. In order for the techniques to become widely used, the gap between theorists and practitioners must be bridged effectively. In particular, safety-critical systems offer an application area where formal methods may be engaged usefully to the benefit of all. This paper discusses some of the issues concerned with the general acceptance of formal methods and concludes with a summary of the current position and how the formal methods community could proceed to improve matters in the future.</p>
