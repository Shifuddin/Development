                        <p class="Para">Sustainable development has become a key concept in environmental and economic policy analysis. From this point of view, it is desirable to integrate culture, legal, business, and financial prospective and increase collaboration among enterprises in order to improve sustainable competitiveness. Enterprises that are collaborating need to define and use performance measurement/management frameworks composed of performance elements (objectives, performance indicators, etc.) that facilitate the management of their activity, as well as monitor their strategy and processes. There are several factors that need to be managed properly in order to support collaborative success. So this chapter aims to present an approach based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to manage collaborative relationships under an integrated approach in order to investigate and promote mechanism design for sustainability. With this approach, enterprises will obtain significant information for the decision-making process regarding sustainable performance elements that have the greatest impact on their competitiveness and therefore should be prioritized.</p>
