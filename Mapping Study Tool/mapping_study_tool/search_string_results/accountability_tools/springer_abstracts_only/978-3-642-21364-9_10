                          <p class="Para">The core of this paper is a science fiction short story. We are on planet DOR. A group of scientists are working on an experiment, changing underlying mechanisms of transmissions of a colossus machine(a complex system of gears and levers, wires and pipes. Some of its mechanisms are also known as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">D </em>for doctors, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">F </em>for pharmacists, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">P </em>for patients. Observers travel from Earth to study the experiment. Their dilemmas are unaided by their advanced research tools. The story is inspired by research carried out for the evaluation of the forthcoming electronic prescription service in England. Our story is fiction, but it is also a methodological means, a reflexive lever to elaborate and explore our research texts and to question the feasibility, meaning, and impact of researching future technology.</p>
