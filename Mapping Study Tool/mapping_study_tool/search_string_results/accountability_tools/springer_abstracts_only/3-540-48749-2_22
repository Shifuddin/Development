                          <p class="Para">The mobile agent paradigm gains ever more acceptance for the creation of distributed applications, particularly in the domain of electronic commerce. In such applications, a mobile agent roams the global Internet in search of services for its owner. One of the problems with this approach is that malicious service providers on the agentâ€™s itinerary can access confidential information contained in the agent or tamper with the agent.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this article we identify trust as a major issue in this context and propose a pessimistic approach to trust that tries to prevent malicious behaviour rather than correcting it. The approach relies on a trusted and tamper-resistant hardware device that provides the mobile agent with the means to protect itself. Finally, we show that the approach is not limited to protecting the mobile agents of a user but can also be extended to protect the mobile agents of a trusted third party in order to take full advantage of the mobile agent paradigm.</p>
