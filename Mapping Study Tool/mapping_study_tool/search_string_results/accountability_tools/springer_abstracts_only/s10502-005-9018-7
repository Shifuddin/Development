                          <p class="Para">The author, a professor at the University of Toronto, touches briefly on the extensive and rich archival literature that supports the teaching of macroappraisal, but notes that this is not the only educational material she offers her students when teaching appraisal theory. She discusses the usefulness to archivists of literature from the fields of ethnography, organizational knowing, records in history, personal documentary behaviour, memory, and communications, noting that the use of texts from these fields can encourage students to reflect on their own presumptions and to develop a taste for the wide reading and research that must support appraisal.</p>
