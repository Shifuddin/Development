                          <p class="Para">Peer-to-peer computing has been emerged as very popular application due to the strong retrieval performance and the easiness of sharing resource and information. Nonetheless in reality p2p users are demanding more privacy rather than share of information. In this study we propose mutual anonymity technique based on length-restricted multi-path for identity of initiator and responder and the anonymous communication between initiator and responder. In this technique is not easily revealed to denial of service attack by ensuring the anonymity of initiator and responder and anonymous communication is possible by means of grouping technique of intermediate nodes. Compared with the previous studies privacy can easily be ensured without causing cryptography processing overhead by using former protocol only. Overhead, expected in the proposed technique of intermediate node grouping, is evaluated through test.</p>
