                          <p class="Para">In an attempt to solve the current and future problems in electronic recordkeeping the Dutch government, namely the Minister of the Interior, and the Minister of Culture, established a nation wide program: Digital Longevity (Digitale Duurzaamheid). The program is run by a bureau, staffed by consultants from the ministry of the Interior, the National Archives, and a province. By various means the bureau creates awareness at the political and senior management levels, develops policies for electronic recordkeeping, and supports implementation. The program contributes to the developing of theories in the area, supports research, and cooperates in education and training. Via pilot projects the consultants keep in touch with record creating organizations. As an opus magnum the program works on a generic design of a recordkeeping system, including a structured definition of recordkeeping functional requirements.</p>
