                          <p class="Para">The objective of the MOTHIS workshop was to discuss model-based methods for the design of Health Information Systems (HIS) offering a revolutionary new way for the interaction between medical patients and Health Care Providers. Although healthcare, like other information-intensive industries, has developed and deployed standards-based, secure information infrastructures it is still dependent upon paper records and fragmented, error-prone approaches to service delivery. The primary concern is that security and privacy need to be organically integrated into HIS architectures. The workshop brought together computer scientists, medical experts, and legal policy experts to discuss research results in the development and application of model-based methods for representing, analyzing and integrating, architectures, privacy and security policies, computer security mechanisms, web authentication, and human factors engineering.</p>
