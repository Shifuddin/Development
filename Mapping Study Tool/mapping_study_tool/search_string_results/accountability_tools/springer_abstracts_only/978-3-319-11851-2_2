                        <p class="Para">Privacy by design will become a legal obligation in the European Community if the Data Protection Regulation eventually gets adopted.

We propose an approach based on the specification of privacy architectures and focus on a key aspect of privacy, data minimisation, and its tension with integrity requirements. We illustrate our formal framework through a smart metering case study.</p>
