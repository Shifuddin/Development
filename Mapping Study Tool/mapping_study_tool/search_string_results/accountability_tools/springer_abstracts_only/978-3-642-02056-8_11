                          <p class="Para">Information is essential to decision making. Nowadays, decision makers are often overwhelmed with large volumes of information, some of which may be inaccurate, incorrect, inappropriate, misleading, or maliciously introduced. With the advocated shift of information sharing paradigm from “need to know” to “need to share” this problem will be further compounded. This poses the challenge of achieving assured information sharing so that decision makers can always get and utilize the up-to-date information for making the right decisions, despite the existence of malicious attacks and without breaching privacy of honest participants. As a first step towards answering this challenge this paper proposes a systematic framework we call TIUPAM, which stands for “Trustworthiness-centric Identity, Usage, Provenance, and Attack Management.” The framework is centered at the need of trustworthiness and risk management for decision makers, and supported by four key components: identity management, usage management, provenance management and attack management. We explore the characterization of both the core functions and the supporting components in the TIUPAM framework, which may guide the design and realization of concrete schemes in the future.</p>
