                        <p class="Para">We put many of the new fault induction and reverse engineering attacks on secure systems into the context of real device implementations and actual systems. We describe countermeasures that diminish the overall practical significance of these new results when considered in the context of a rational design process and an overall systems security strategy.</p>
