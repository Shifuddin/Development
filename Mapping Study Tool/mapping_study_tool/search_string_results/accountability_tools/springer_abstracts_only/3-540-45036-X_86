                          <p class="Para">There are many types of security that have been applied to secure Electronic Commerce nowadays. Mainstream security depends on equipment-based security mechanisms, which are a concern in terms of security issues as a whole. The necessity of strong security for Electronic Commerce has increased as a result of the whole process and the devices used. This thesis proposes an appropriate security management system TDM which is enforced security management system for ECommerce. The idea of QoSS and a Threat-Adaptive Security Policy is examined in detail in order to apply a conceptual approach to the XML document which is a standard data format for data exchange including that of the Internet. An analysis of the existing system is used in order to suggest appropriate next-generation security management for XML document security. This work contributes to expanding existing security management in the XML document area in order to establish a flexible security policy.</p>
