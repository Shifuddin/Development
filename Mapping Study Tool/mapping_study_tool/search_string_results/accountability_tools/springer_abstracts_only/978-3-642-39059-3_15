                          <p class="Para">We propose a new encryption primitive called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Membership Encryption</em>. Let <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{G})\)</span> be a privacy-preserving token on a group attribute/identity <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">G</strong>, such that given <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{G})\)</span> it is hard to know the attributes in <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">G</strong>. In this membership encryption, if an encryption takes as input an attribute <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> and the token <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{G})\)</span>, the decryption requires holding the membership <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> ∈ <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">G</strong>, i.e., <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">A</em> belongs to this group attribute. Membership encryption is applicable in constructing membership proof <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(A\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{G})\)</span> with privacy preserving on group attribute and the membership. Membership encryption can be also utilized to construct an efficient two-round <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em>-out-of-<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em> oblivious transfer protocol. In this paper, we construct a provably secure membership encryption where the group token <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{G})\)</span> is constant-size with maximum number accountability on attributes. Using our scheme, the proposed oblivious transfer protocol exhibits the nice feature of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(1) communication cost for any <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">K</em> from receiver to sender, and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">N</em>) communication cost from sender to receiver.</p>
