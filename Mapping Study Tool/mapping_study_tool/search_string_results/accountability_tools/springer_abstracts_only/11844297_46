                          <p class="Para">Pattern classification seeks to minimize error of unknown patterns, however, in many real world applications, type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors have to be dealt with separately, which is a complex problem since an attempt to minimize one of them usually makes the other grow. Actually, a type of error can be more important than the other, and a trade-off that minimizes the most important error type must be reached. Despite the importance of type-II errors, most pattern classification methods take into account only the global classification error. In this paper we propose to optimize both error types in classification by means of a multiobjective algorithm in which each error type and the network size is an objective of the fitness function. A modified version of the GProp method (optimization and design of multilayer perceptrons) is used, to simultaneously optimize the network size and the type I and II errors.</p>
