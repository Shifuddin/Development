                          <p class="Para">Stakes and challenges of e-security are analyzed to point out key issues in mastering information technologies risks. Lessons from the past are summarized to explain why security solutions are not effective.

The validity of such model requires a challenging multidimensional approach of e-security. Several reflection axis and recommendations to guide the conceptualization of a unified e-security framework are proposed.</p>
