                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we propose a novel secure routing protocol named Secure Multi-pAths Routing for wireless sensor neTworks (SMART) as well as its underlying key management scheme named <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Extended Two-hop Keys Establishment</em> (ETKE). The proposed framework keeps consistent routing topology by protecting the hop count information from being forged. It also ensures a fast detection of inconsistent routing information without referring to the sink node. We analyze the security of the proposed scheme as well as its resilience probability against the forged hop count attack. We have demonstrated through simulations that SMART outperforms a comparative solution in literature, i.e., SeRINS, in terms of energy consumption.</p>
