Binding confidentiality requirements is required with business surveys. The Bank of Italy’s infrastructure BIRD pursues at the same time two seemingly conflicting aims: to allow researchers to explore and model business survey data, while preserving anonymity of individual information. The system is based on the Lissy platform (already adopted by the Luxembourg Income Study and other research centres). Firms’ data confidentiality is safeguarded by a number of means.
