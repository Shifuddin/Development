                          <p class="Para">This paper aims to stress the potential use of executive support systems (ESS) in the formulation of university objectives and strategies. A strategic planning methodology based on different university experiences is proposed, along with an ESS that we have designed and developed to support the strategic process. We present the methodology and show how to put it into practice by using our application. Finally, we discuss some results obtained at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, as well as the major obstacles and resistance raised both to the strategic planning and to the computerization of the process</p>
