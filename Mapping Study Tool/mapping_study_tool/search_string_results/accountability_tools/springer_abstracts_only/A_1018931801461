                          <p class="Para">There comes a time in most group discussions that a decision has to be made. This is the role most often filled by the voting process. Through computer and telecommunication technology, new capabilities have been added to this age old process. It is important to understand the implications of these new capabilities and the voting process as a whole to fully take advantage of the opportunities and avoid the pitfalls they provide. This paper investigates the implications of voting in a group decision support system (GDSS) environ-ment. Procedural and operational issues related to the voting process are identified. These issues are used to compare and contrast a number of voting protocols. Many of the protocols have been implemented and tested in the CM<sup>3</sup> (Computer Mediated Meeting Management) group decision support system.</p>
