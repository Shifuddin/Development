                          <p class="Para">Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and cloud computing are becoming more and more important in the World of Information Technology (IT) and Communication. These are two different sectors of modern information systems, and there are several in-depth investigations about ERP and also cloud computing. Recently, there have been some studies on ERP in cloud computing, but not much work as regards its applications in the field of education has been done. Besides that, deploying traditional ERP systems can be challenging and often costly and resource intensive. However, with the emergence of cloud-based ERP solutions, it has lower cost implications than traditional ERP. In this scenario, implementing a study on cloud-based ERP for modern education is an important and beneficial work. By considering this point, the objective of this research is to approach the relevant concepts multi-dimensionally; illustrating the advantages and challenges of cloud-based ERP on education and proposing a cloud-based ERP solution that can apply to any educational institution in Vietnam.</p>
