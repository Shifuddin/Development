                        <p class="Para">The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growth of e-services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health). This proliferation of e-services has put large quantities of customer private information in the hands of service providers, who in many cases have mishandled the information to the detriment of customer privacy. As a result, government bodies have put in place privacy legislation that spells out the privacy rights of customers and how their private information is to be handled. Service providers are required to comply with this privacy legislation. This paper proposes a cooperative visualization technique that can be employed by service providers to understand how private information flows within their organizations, as a way of identifying privacy risks or vulnerabilities that can lead to violations of privacy legislation. The description of the technique includes a model of how an e-service uses private information, a graphical notation for the visualization, and an application example.</p>
