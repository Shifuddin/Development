                          <p class="Para">As of 2003, 99% of K-12 schools in the United States use the Internet.&nbsp; With the increased use of databases and other technologies to manage data in K-12 institutions, an inherent threat to the privacy and confidentiality of that information has also increased.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last decade, with the increased use of these technologies, there has also been an increase in the number of privacy-related violations that have occurred, both in industry and in the K-12 environment.&nbsp; There are a plethora of security technologies that can be used to improve privacy; however, organizations such as K-12 schools often cannot afford to hire IT staff versed in the state of the art.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, technology alone will not address security and privacy problems; policy is an essential ingredient for any organization.&nbsp; This study is a gap analysis investigating privacy practices of public educators in the Midwestern portion of the United States.&nbsp; The significance of the work is that we cannot improve the practices unless we understand deficiencies in current privacy practices and perceptions.</p>
