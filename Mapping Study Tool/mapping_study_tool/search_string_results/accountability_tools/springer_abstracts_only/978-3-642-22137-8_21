                        <p class="Para">In this paper, we pursue towards understanding how to design and analyse cryptographic protocols in a (large) network setting where all communication is solely based on the publish/subscribe paradigm. That is, we expect a stack and network architecture where all message passing is based on publish/subscribe rather than send/receive, all the way down to the link layer. Under those assumptions, it looks like that the majority of present work on cryptographic protocol analysis applies to an extent, with only minor modifications mostly on the notation side, while the protocol design aspects will need larger modifications. Furthermore, the paradigm shift opens a number of interesting problems, requiring modifications to many of the traditional intuitions guiding protocol design and analysis.</p>
