                        <p class="Para">Designing security protocols is not complicated, unless you insist on making the same mistakes over and over. It depends on what you call designing; once you have the requirements it might be not too hard to make security protocols. But the complications are in finding the right requirements, and that’s maybe the biggest question that I want to approach today: what to do with requirements in security protocols. My presentation is divided in two parts. First some general question asking; it’s not answers that I will give today. Second I will look at a simple example, the example of Secret Santa. This is joint work with Saša Radomirović and Peter Ryan.</p>
