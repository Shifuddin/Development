                          <p class="Para">Electronic data interchange (EDI) has been around for more than a decade. It addresses a fundamental and enduring business problem — the exchange of data between the computer systems of organisations. It is currently the cornerstone of a number of successful global companies. However, its future lies with new 'trusted third parties' which combine data management with public key infrastructure, offering enhanced message switching and message translation in response to market trends.</p>
                          <p class="Para">'eBusiness' has a number of forms — business to consumer, now growing fast as 'Web-shopping', consumer to consumer, and business to business, the longest established. In the last category there is a major sub-area of 'upply-chain-driven' trading. This was the first area of automation and was initiated by the process-driven industries such as retail distribution, automotive manufacture and international logistics. Indeed, whole industries are today totally dependent on EDI-driven processes.</p>
