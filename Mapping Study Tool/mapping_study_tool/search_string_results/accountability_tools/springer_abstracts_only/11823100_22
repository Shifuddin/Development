                          <p class="Para">How can the flexibility of an information architecture in e-government chains – defined as a set of multi-rational agreements – be achieved, if one acknowledges the fact that the use of ICT may automate the status quo between organizations which work together in a policy chain? Research shows that flexibility cannot only be achieved by looking at technological requirements and agreements. Also other agreements should be considered which express other (political, legal and economic) design rationalities and values. Moreover, flexibility is also influenced by the structure and dynamics of the power and trustworthiness of the relationships between the organizations involved.</p>
