                          <p class="Para">In this paper, the authors consider the prospects for embedding privacy into biometric technology through biometric encryption (BE) to deliver both privacy and security, particularly as more and more countries are exploring the use of biometric solutions for the purpose of authentication. This discussion arises from Commissioner Ann Cavoukian’s seminal work in the area of BE and Max Snijder’s early work on anonymous biometrics and e-Identity. It touches on the distinguishing features of the algorithmic process defined by BE, the terminology that best describes this process, and provides a springboard for further thought leadership on the policies and guidelines needed to distinguish between conventional and untraceable biometrics schemes.</p>
