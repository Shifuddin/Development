                          <p class="Para">This paper discusses the concept of a virtual digital forensic laboratory, which incorporates networked examination and storage machines, secure communications, multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and case management and digital asset management systems. Laboratory activities such as the examination, storage and presentation of digital evidence can be geographically distributed and accessed over a network by users with the appropriate credentials. The advantages of such a facility include reduced costs through shared resources and the availability of advanced expertise for specialized cases.</p>
