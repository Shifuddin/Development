                          <p class="Para">We introduce a revocation model for handling personal data in cyberspace. The model is motivated by a series of focus groups undertaken by the EnCoRe project aimed at understanding the control requirements of a variety of data subjects. We observe that there is a lack of understanding of the various technical options available for implementing revocation preferences, and introduce the concept of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">informed revocation</em> by analogy to Faden and Beauchampâ€™s <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">informed consent</em>. We argue that we can overcome the limitations associated with informed consent via the implementation of EnCoRe technology solutions. Finally, we apply our model and demonstrate its validity to a number of data-handling scenarios which have arisen in the context of the EnCoRe research project. We have found that data subjects tend to alter their default privacy preferences when they are informed of all the different types of revocation available to them.</p>
