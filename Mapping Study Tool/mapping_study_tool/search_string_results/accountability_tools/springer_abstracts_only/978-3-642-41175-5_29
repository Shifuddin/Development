                          <p class="Para">Learning Analytics has become a major research area recently. In particular learning institutions seek ways to collect, manage, analyze and exploit data from learners and instructors for the facilitation of formal learning processes. However, in the world of informal learning at the workplace, knowledge gained from formal learning analytics is only applicable on a commodity level. Since professional communities need learning support beyond this level, we need a deep understanding of interactions between learners and other entities in community-regulated learning processes - a conceptual extension of self-regulated learning processes. In this paper, we discuss scaling challenges for community learning analytics, give both conceptual and technical solutions, and report experiences from ongoing research in this area.</p>
