                          <p class="Para">Grid user management aims to effectively manage grid user accounts. The traditional model to manage grid user accounts has several disadvantages. With the enlargement of the scale of the grid computing environment, these disadvantages will become more obvious. In contrast to the traditional model of grid user management, we propose a model that is based on the concept of account mapping. This allows us to facilitate user management and improve the scalability, security and accounting, and make uniform management possible.</p>
