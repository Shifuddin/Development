                        <p class="Para">This paper discusses non-repudiation services regarding the transfer of a message and classifies the roles of trusted third parties involved in non-repudiation services. We examine the selective receipt problem and the generation of time evidence, analyse the current state of the ISO/IEC 13888 drafts on non-repudiation mechanisms, and present a fair non-repudiation protocol including time evidence to promote the development of these drafts.</p>
