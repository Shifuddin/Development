                          <p class="Para">Nowadays, research initiatives to redesign the Internet are popping up around the world. Each of these projects has a particular focus and its own set of design requirements and key technologies. The panorama shows a wide diversity of pre-requirements and arguments, some very specific and superficial, others more general and deep. Despite this diversity, a conceptual-driven analysis of such scenario could reveal the current state-of-the-art on future Internet research, the common aspects that permeate all initiatives, and the open issues to be addressed in future work. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the contemporary research from an abstract point of view, covering the design requirements and ingredients that are being adopted, interrelating, and analyzing them.</p>
