                          <p class="Para">In recent years, much of the focus in archival literature and endeavour has been directed towards the management of digital records. The need to work closely with information and communication technology (ICT) professionals is essential if digital preservation aspirations are to be realised. However, consideration has not been given to the challenges inherent in being respected or trusted by this occupational group. As a preliminary step to identifying possible cultural differences, a survey was developed to investigate the perceptions of ICT professionals as regards digital archives and the role of recordkeepers. Findings from this survey show differences in the perception of trustworthiness in terms of abilities to manage paper versus digital records. In addition, responses also highlight risks inherent in developing digital archives which do not take access requirements sufficiently into account. We suggest that attention must be paid to this dimension of custody if digital archives initiatives are to succeed.</p>
