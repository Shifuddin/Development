                          <p class="Para">Clinical genomics, the marriage of clinical information and knowledge about the human or pathogen genome, holds enormous promise for the healthcare and life sciences domain. Based on a more in-depth understanding of the human and pathogen molecular interaction, clinical genomics can be used to discover new targeted drugs and provide personalized therapies with fewer side effects, at reduced costs, and with higher efficacy. A key enabler of clinical genomics is a sound standards-based biomedical information integration middleware. This middleware must be able to de-identify, integrate and correlate clinical, clinical trials, genomic and images metadata from the various systems. We describe MedII, a novel biomedical information integration research technology that some of its components were integrated in IBM Clinical Genomics solution. We also introduce the need for biomedical information preservation to assist in ensuring that the integrated biomedical information can be read and interpreted decades from now.</p>
