                        <p class="Para">With this paper we introduce information security aspects and concepts to the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Starting from a functional view of CSCW technology and the definition of the relevant security areas we outline a catalogue of security criteria which should be fulfilled by CSCW applications in order to increase the acceptance and reliability of such systems. Classical information security criteria such as confidentiality are adapted to the specific security requirements of CSCW applications and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">new</em> security criteria being specific to CSCW applications are presented. Furthermore, we propose how to map CSCW artefacts (such as collaborative writing) onto security criteria.</p>
