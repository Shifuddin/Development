                        <p class="Para">A number of people have started talking today by saying I wanted to figure out what such and such term means. What does integrity mean? What does confidentiality mean? I definitely don’t want to give you the impression I’m going to tell you what trust means. Trust management is supposed to be an incredibly vague and provocative term invented by Matt Blaze. I don’t know whether he intended it that way, but it comes naturally to him. What I find is that trust management the term induces this projection. People hear it and they think “Oh, that sounds good, that’s what I need”. So that’s good. So what I am going to do is give you a motivating example, tell you a little bit about what we’re trying to accomplish by building a trust management system and what are the essential design decisions we need when we build the PolicyMaker trust management system and then some open questions.</p>
