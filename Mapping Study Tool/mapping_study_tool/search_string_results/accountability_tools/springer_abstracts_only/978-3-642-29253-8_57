                          <p class="Para">Personally-identifiable information (PII) is increasingly processed in a distributed way. This makes it much harder for individuals to oversee how their PII is used. In the legal systems of many countries, processing of PII is subject to restrictions. In particular, companies have to inform an individual on how they use his PII, and which external parties they transfer it to. We hypothesize that na√Øve approaches like log messages or plain text are not sufficient to this end. We in turn have developed a user-friendly auditing facility based on business processes (BPs). It visualizes data processing in real time, using the graphical process models one would deploy on a BP engine for execution. We also propose an approach to let a BP-management system generate the necessary audit events at runtime. An evaluation of realistic scenarios with users shows that our tool helps them to understand how their PII is used.</p>
