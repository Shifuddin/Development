                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient trust scheme with Bayesian theory to detect whether a node is malicious or not. In order to improve the correctness of detecting behavior, we aim to consider the influence with respect to the internal attacks of compromised nodes as many as possible. Moreover, the information of malicious behaviors is collected by their neighboring nodes and fused by the foregoing hop nodes. And then, the trust value concerning some node is computed by its father node in a route. Moreover, the key exchange of a secure route is implemented by the modified Diffieâ€“Hellman key agreement protocol to guard against man-in-the-middle attack. The simulation results show that, with the increase of trust ratio, the Bayesian theorem can make more credible judgment on whether the network nodes are secure than the Beta function and the efficient clustering scheme for group key management in the present of malicious nodes.</p>
