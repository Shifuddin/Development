                          <p class="Para">A new appraisal method for national government records introduced in the 1990s aimed at reducing backlogs in the transfer of pre-1976 records to the National Archives of the Netherlands. Since then, appraisal and disposition decisions are based on macro analysis. Preventing new backlogs from occurring was a second goal. The so-called project PIVOT (1991â€“2001 and after) coordinated the introduction, development, and implementation of the new appraisal method. This article describes the objectives, method, and appraisal criteria, as well as the criticism and laborious progress of this ongoing story.</p>
