                          <p class="Para">Organisations increasingly interoperate with others to participate in Virtual Organisations or VO. This leads to models that need to deal with open service interaction with multiple levels of openness. Other VO security and safety challenges include decentralised operation and management, interoperability, balancing privacy versus accountability, managing error events with multiple semantics and managing anomaly events versus normal variations. The interrelationships, interactions and behaviours of agents in MAS and multi-MAS (MMAS) are analogous to those in VO. MAS provide a useful method of modelling VO, to manage their and to make them secure and safer.</p>
