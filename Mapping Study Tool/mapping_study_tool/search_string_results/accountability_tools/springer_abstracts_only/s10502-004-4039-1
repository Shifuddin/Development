                          <p class="Para">A continuing theme of the archival literature from the “New World Countries” of the Australia, Canada and the United States is the lack of understanding and appreciation of archivists and archival work. The author posits that this situation can be ameliorated if archivists understand the temperament characteristics that shape their own attitudes and behaviours and thus influence their interactions with significant others in the workplace and wider community. This essay reports and interprets major findings of a survey of temperament types present among members of the Australian Society of Archivists, conducted as part of a 1998 three-country [Australia, Canada and the USA] study.</p>
