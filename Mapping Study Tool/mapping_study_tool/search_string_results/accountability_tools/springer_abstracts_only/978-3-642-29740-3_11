                          <p class="Para">A shift of interest of both providers and consumers from resource provisioning to a system of infrastructure services as well for a governance system for e-Infrastructures based on a user-centric approach is registered nowadays. Applying service level management tools and procedures in e-Infrastructure service provision practices allow users, service providers and funding agencies to investigate e-Infrastructure services in view of individual use cases. The shift should be sustained by legal structures, strategic and financial plans, as well as by openness, neutrality and diversity of resources and services. e-IRG as an e-infrastructure policy forum envisioned these trends and needs and expressed its position in its recent white paper that is shortly presented and discussed from a perspective of building future research agendas of individual teams.</p>
