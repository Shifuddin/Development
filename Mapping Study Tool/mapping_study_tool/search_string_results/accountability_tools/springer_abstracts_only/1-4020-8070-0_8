                          <p class="Para">This paper explores the possibility to represent the privacy policies of an individual, as well as the processing steps of those who (concurrently) process the data, using a simple process algebra, FSP. The approach leads to the identification of two major classes of privacy policies: aggregation policies and quantitative policies. Automated analysis (with the LTSA tool) of such policies, in combination with the actions of parties that process personal information allows the automated discovery of possible breaches of privacy.</p>
                          <p class="Para">It is demonstrated that addressing the breaches often involves tradeoffs, such discontinuing interaction with some parties, so that policies are no longer violated.</p>
