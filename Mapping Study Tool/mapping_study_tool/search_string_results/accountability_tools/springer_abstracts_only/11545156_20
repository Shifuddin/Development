                          <p class="Para">This paper is based on a research project presently carried out by the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA). The Ministry for Public Service in Luxembourg has requested EIPA to conduct a report on “Organisational Changes, Skills and the Role of Leadership required by eGovernment” to provide a basis for discussions during the EU Presidency of Luxembourg in the eGovernment working group of the European Public Administration Network (EPAN) in the first half of 2005. The report should provide some input for the recommendations to be agreed upon by the Director-Generals responsible for public administration in the EU by the end of 2005. The report will be finalised in June 2005.</p>
