                          <p class="Para">Online auction is an interesting component of the electronic commerce. Goods and services that used to be sold in conventional brick-and-mortar stores at fixed prices can now be purchased online at their “true” valuations in the eyes of multiple customers. With the growing sheer number and total value of these transactions conducted under the online auction model, the actual security becomes a controversial issue. This is where cryptographic methods, some already decades old, others brand-new and specialized for the application in the realm of auctions, come into the game. This paper attempts to give an overview of the current state of affairs and convergent issues for cryptographic methods applicable to the field of on-line auctions.</p>
