                          <p class="Para">With software services becoming a strategic capability for the software sector, software architecture needs to address integration problems to help services to collaborate and coordinate their activities. The increasing need to address dynamic and automated changes can be answered by a service coordination architecture with event-based collaboration that enables dynamic and adaptive architectures. Intelligent service and process identification and adaptation techniques are suitable solutions for event-driven and on-demand service architectures. We define an architectural solution space and identify research challenges.</p>
