                          <p class="Para">The availability of contents and information as linked data or Web services, i.e. over standardized interfaces, fosters the integration and reuse of data. One common form of information integration is the creation of composed documents, e.g. in form of dynamic Web pages. Service and data providers restrict allowed usage of their resources and and link it to obligations, e.g. only non-commercial usage is allowed and requires an attribution of the provider. These terms and conditions are currently typically available in natural language which makes checking, if a document composition is compliant with the policies of the used services, a tedious task. In order to make it easier for users to adhere to these usage policies, we propose to formalize them, which enables policy-aware tools that support the creation of compliant compositions. In this paper we propose an OWL model of document compositions and show how it can be used together with the policy language AIR to build a policy-aware document composition platform. We furthermore present a use case and illustrate how it can be realized with our approach.</p>
