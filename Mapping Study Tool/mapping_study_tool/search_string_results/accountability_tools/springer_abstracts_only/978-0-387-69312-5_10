                        <p class="Para">All schools store a considerable amount of administrative data on their students, and this is collected from a number of different sources. Depending on the requirements of their national or state education systems most schools store this data in a prescribed format so that it can be used to prepare reports for these education authorities and for local school use. The question we ask is whether any other classroom use can be made of all this data, and that is the question addressed in this paper. In the paper we examine a case study of a primary school in the state of Victoria, Australia and how it is attempting to come to grips with this question.</p>
