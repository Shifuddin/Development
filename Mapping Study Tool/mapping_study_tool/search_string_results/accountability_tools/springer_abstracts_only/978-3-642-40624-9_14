                        <p class="Para">Action Languages are simple logical formalisms to describe the properties of a domain and the behavior of an agent and to reason about it. They offer an elegant solution to the frame problem, but are inapt to reason with norms in which an obligation deadline may require the agent to adapt its behavior even though no action occurred. In this paper we extend the Action Language <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> with features that allow reasoning about norms and time in dynamic domains. Unlike previous extensions of Action Languages with norms, our resulting language is expressive enough to represent and reason with different kinds of obligations with deadlines that explicitly refer to time, as well as norm violations and even simple contrary-to-duty obligations resulting from the satisfaction or violation of an agentâ€™s obligations.</p>
