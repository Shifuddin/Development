                          <p class="Para">Privacy is a necessary component of any security discussion. Privacy and security must be considered separately as well as together. Threads of privacy are visible throughout the procedure of building security solutions for any system. The notions for privacy also play an important role in the technical implications of privacy preservation within any network or its subsystems. Analyzing the mitigations and protections for privacy are considered in privacy notions. The privacy notions being theoretical systems and identified vulnerabilities in the sensor networks not being mapped to such privacy preservation notions necessities the analytical review of privacy provisioning in wireless sensor network (WSN) being formalized within a framework consisting or the vulnerabilities associated with each component of the network and mechanisms of privacy preservation along with the privacy notions. The current research paper provides an analytical review of the privacy provisioning in WSNs with the perspective of development of a proposed framework for privacy notions and quantitative as well as qualitative measures associated with the privacy preservation in sensor network mapped with the various techniques implemented for privacy preservation of different components of the network and the network as a whole. This analytical review has been done on the basis of set of beliefs that an adversary has while launching an attack on the network. Further the existing techniques for privacy preservation of receiver and source node location, location of sink node, traffic analysis prevention and preserving temporal privacy in WSN have been analyses on the basis of adversary’s set of beliefs’ mitigated by them and the notion of privacy implemented by these techniques like k-anonymity, l-diversity or t-closeness. The present effort aims to provide the researchers with an insight of the new concept of belief mitigation for privacy provisioning in WSN.</p>
