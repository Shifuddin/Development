                        <p class="Para">When monitoring system behavior to check compliance against a given policy, one is sometimes confronted with incomplete knowledge about system events. In IT systems, such incompleteness may arise from logging infrastructure failures and corrupted log files, or when the logs produced by different system components disagree on whether actions took place. In this paper, we present a policy language with a three-valued semantics that allows one to explicitly reason about incomplete knowledge and handle disagreements. Furthermore, we present a monitoring algorithm for an expressive fragment of our policy language. We illustrate through examples how our approach extends compliance monitoring to systems with logging failures and disagreements.</p>
