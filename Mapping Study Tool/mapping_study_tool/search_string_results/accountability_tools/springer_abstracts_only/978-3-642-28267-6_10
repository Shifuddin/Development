                        <p class="Para">The role of security in modern IT systems is continuously growing. Large infrastructures have to be protected against sophisticated attacks on organizational, technical and logical levels. Achieving sufficient security level becomes even more difficult for distributed and, often, heterogeneous environments that involve valuable assets and data&nbsp;– like grids. The main goal of the work described within this paper is to provide maximum level of protection against network attackers to the PL-Grid&nbsp;– Polish National Grid Initiative&nbsp;– infrastructure.</p>
