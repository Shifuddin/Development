                          <p class="Para">This paper presents a new protocol for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> + 1st-price auction, a style of auction in which the highest <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> bidders win and pay a uniform price, determined by the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> + 1)st price. A set of distributed servers collaborates to resolve the (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">M</em> + 1)st price without revealing any information in terms of bids including the winnersâ€™ bids. A new trick to jointly and securely compute the highest value as a degree of distributed polynomials is introduced. The building block requires just one round for bidders to cast bids and one round for auctioneers to determine the winners.</p>
