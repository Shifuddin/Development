                        <p class="Para">Modlnt is a compact Java class designed for the arbitrary-precision modular arithmetic operations used in secure cryptographical applications, including auctions and electronic voting. The library is small enough to port to a Java-enabled cellular phone. In this paper, we present a new electronic voting system using the Modlnt library, in which voters have their ballots encrypted with the public key of a trusted agent and cast them to an untrusted server, which tallies them without decrypting the ballot and updates a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) consisting of log n ciphertexts. The privacy of voters is therefore assured assuming that the security of the public-key crypto system is maintained, and the trusted party keeps their private key secure. This feature reduces the costs of management of the counting server, which is now free from the risks of being compromised.</p>
