                        <p class="Para">Due to the forensic value of audit logs, it is vital to provide <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">compromise resiliency</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">append-only</em> properties in a logging system to prevent active attackers. Unfortunately, existing symmetric secure logging schemes are not publicly verifiable and cannot address applications that require public auditing (e.g., public financial auditing), besides being vulnerable to certain attacks and dependent on continuous trusted server support. Moreover, Public Key Cryptography (PKC)-based secure logging schemes require Expensive Operations (ExpOps) that are costly for both loggers and verifiers, and thus are impractical for computation-intensive environments.</p>
