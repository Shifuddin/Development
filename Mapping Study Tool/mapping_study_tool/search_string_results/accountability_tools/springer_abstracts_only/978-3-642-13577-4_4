                          <p class="Para">A prerequisite to implement effective and efficient Information Systems security measures is to have a clear understanding of both, the business that the system will support and the importance of the system in the operating environment. Similarly, the evaluation of oneâ€™s confidence in the deployed safeguarding measures, to adequately protect system assets, requires a better understanding of the security criticality of the system within its context of use (i.e. where is the system used and what for?). This paper proposes metrics as well as a methodology for the evaluation of operational systems security assurance. A critical feature of our approach is that assurance level is dependent on the measurement of security correctness and system security criticality. To that extend, we also propose a novel classification scheme for Information Systems based on their security criticality. Our work is illustrated with an application based on the case study of a Domain Name Server (DNS).</p>
