                          <p class="Para">Flexibility requirements can appear in the middle of a software development, perceived by several client requests to change the application. A flexible domain model, usually implemented with using the adaptive object model (AOM) architectural style, required custom-made components to handle the current implementation of the domain entities. The problem is that by evolving an AOM model, the components need to be evolved as well, which generates constant rework. This work studied the possible AOM evolution paths, in order to provide support in the components for model changing. An evolution of the Esfinge AOM RoleMapper framework were developed to provide this functionality, allowing AOM models in different stages to be mapped to a single structure. The study was evaluated using a set of tests that were applied in each possible structure for the model.</p>
