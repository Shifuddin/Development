                        <p class="Para">Sanitizable signatures allow for controlled modification of signed data. The essential security requirements are accountability, privacy and unlinkability. Unlinkability is a strong notion of privacy. Namely, it makes it hard to link two sanitized messages that were derived from the same message-signature pair. In this work, we strengthen the standard unlinkability definition by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Brzuska</em> et al. at PKC ’10, making it robust against malicious or buggy signers. While state-of-the art schemes deploy costly group signatures to achieve unlinkability, our construction uses standard digital signatures, which makes them compatible with existing infrastructure.</p>
                        <p class="Para">We construct a sanitizable signature scheme that satisfies the strong notion of perfect unlinkability and, simultaneously, achieves the strongest notion of accountability, i.e., non-interactive public accountability. Our construction is not only legally compliant, but also highly efficient, as the measurements of our reference implementation show. Finally, we revisit the security model by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Canard</em> et al. and correct a small flaw in their security definition given at AfricaCrypt ’12.</p>
