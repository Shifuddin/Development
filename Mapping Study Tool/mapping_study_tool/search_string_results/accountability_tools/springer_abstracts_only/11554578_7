                          <p class="Para">This paper covers intrusion detection and security information management technologies. It presents a primer on intrusion detection, focusing on data sources and analysis techniques. Data sources presented therein are classified according to the capture mechanism and we include an evaluation of the accuracy of these data sources. Analysis techniques are classified into misuse detection, using the explicit body of knowledge about security attacks to generate alerts, and anomaly detection, where the safe or normal operation of the monitored information system is described and alerts generated for anything that does not belong to that model. It then describes security information management and alert correlation technologies that are in use today. We particularly describe statistical modeling of alert flows and explicit correlation between alert information and vulnerability assessment information.</p>
