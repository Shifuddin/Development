                          <p class="Para">The increased use of Internet has accelerated the evolution of call centres: from simple centres with few telephone lines to sophisticated web call centres that give users different instruments to search information.

Recently, the idea of using web call centres is gaining popularity in the public sector too. This paper presents and discusses the design of Pubblicamente, a newly created Italian web call centre.</p>
