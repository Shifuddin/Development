                          <p class="Para">Analysis of privacy-sensitive data in a multi-party environment often assumes that the parties are well-behaved and they abide by the protocols. Parties compute whatever is needed, communicate correctly following the rules, and do not collude with other parties for exposing third partyâ€™s sensitive data. This paper argues that most of these assumptions fall apart in real-life applications of privacy-preserving distributed data mining (PPDM). This paper offers a more realistic formulation of the PPDM problem as a multi-party game where each party tries to maximize its own objectives. It develops a game-theoretic framework to analyze the behavior of each party in such games and presents detailed analysis of the well known secure sum computation as an example.</p>
