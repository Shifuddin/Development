                          <p class="Para">In this chapter we describe our vision for the next generation of IT services. Services will be automatically discovered, procured and integrated with the service consumerâ€™s technical environment. This whole process will be determined by the policies defined by the consumer and will be transparent to the consumer. We also define the new applications of Policy Manager, Service Manager, Service Procurer and Service Integrator that will allow Smart Services to operate efficiently on the Smart Internet. Usability and User issues are also identified. We illustrate the Smart Services with examples from the health care and multimedia domains.</p>
