                          <p class="Para">This research explores the barriers that marginalized citizens face with access to healthy alternatives to the high calorie, highly-processed foods available in most urban areas. Numerous barriers, including technology-related ones, are identified and propositions are offered that might reduce the negative effect of these challenges/encounters. From examining the benefit to citizens on public assistance that results from adequate education about healthy eating, to education on the existence of accessible healthy alternatives, and access to inexpensive accessible food sources this study focuses on offering possible real world solutions, both technology-related and non-technology related, to the barriers to inclusion of economically marginalized citizens.</p>
