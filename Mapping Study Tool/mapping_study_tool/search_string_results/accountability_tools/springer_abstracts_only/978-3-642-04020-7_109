                          <p class="Para">This paper proposes a SOA-based framework for building complex monitoring and control software systems used in modern process and factory automation today where production processes will span over all types of systems. This framework is developed with utilization of the OPC Unified Architecture (UA) specifications and Object-Oriented Design (OOD). It provides generic components upon which sophisticated production processes can be modeled. Solutions to security of remote invocations are implemented to make this framework capable and reliable. The preliminary experiment results are provided, and the comparison with existing approaches and the discussion are also presented. They demonstrate that the proposed framework is feasible for applying to web service-based monitoring and control system applications.</p>
