                          <p class="Para">This paper gives the main definitions relating to dependability, a generic concept including as special case such attributes as reliability, availability, safety, confidentiality, integrity, maintainability, etc. Basic definitions are given first. They are then commented upon, and supplemented by additional definitions, which address the threats to dependability (faults, errors, failures), and the attributes of dependability. The discussion on the attributes encompasses the relationship of dependability with security, survivability and trustworthiness.</p>
