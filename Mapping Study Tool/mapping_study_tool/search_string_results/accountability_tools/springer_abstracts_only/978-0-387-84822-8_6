                          <p class="Para">The purpose of this chapter is to introduce global ICT programmes, defined as new and universal modes of organising mediated by technology and enacted through a novel mix of policy instruments, international institutions, business interests, and techno/managerial concepts. Largely unexplored in various fields, including information systems as well as many other social sciences studying innovation and digital technologies, such programmes are interesting, not least because of their projected ability to promote innovation and achieve new mechanisms of governance. The chapter argues that a new theoretical understanding for the study of such programmes is needed in order to explore them as a means of technology transfer and to better understand systems of innovation in the developing world.</p>
