                        <p class="Para">The ECOOP Workshop on Mobile Object Systems is now in its 9th year. Over the years, the workshop has dealt with topics related to the movement of code and data between application platforms, security, operating system support, application quality of service, and programming language paradigms. In many cases, the workshop has been a forum to discussed traditional object-oriented issues, since mobility influences such a broad spectrum of topics.</p>
