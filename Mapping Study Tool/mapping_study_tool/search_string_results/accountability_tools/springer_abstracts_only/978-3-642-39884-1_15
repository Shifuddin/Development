                          <p class="Para">This work introduces the most efficient universal accumulator known today. For the first time, we have an accumulator which does not depend on hidden order groups, does not require any exponentiations in the target group associated with the pairing function, and only requires two pairings to verify a proof-of-knowledge of a witness.</p>
                          <p class="Para">We present implementations of our accumulator and another recent proposal utilizing Groth-Sahai proofs, with performance results. Our implementations are designed with cryptography agility in mind. We then built a library for revoking anonymous credentials using any accumulators, and integrated it with Microsoft U-Prove, which has a significant contribution to an European Unionâ€™s privacy standardization effort. Our work enables U-Prove revocation without compromising untraceability.</p>
