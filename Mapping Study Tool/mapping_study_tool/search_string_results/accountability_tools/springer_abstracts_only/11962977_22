                        <p class="Para">In this paper we are focusing on secure logging for public network providers. We review existing security threat models against system logging and we extend these to a new threat model especially suited in the environment of telecommunication network providers. We also propose a framework for secure logging in public communication networks as well as realistic implementations designs, which are more resilient to the identified security threats. A key role to the proposed framework is given to an independent Regulatory Authority, which is responsible to verify the integrity of the log files.</p>
