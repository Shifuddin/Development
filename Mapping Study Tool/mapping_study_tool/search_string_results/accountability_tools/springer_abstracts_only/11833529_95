                          <p class="Para">In general, privacy can be viewed as the right to be left alone when desired (solitude), the right to remain anonymous (anonymity), and the right to confidentiality (secrecy of information). More specifically, location privacy is “the ability to prevent other parties from learning one’s current or past locations”. In this paper, we focus on two primitives that make up location privacy: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">identity information</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">location information.</em> Identity information has to do with the static attributes and characteristics that uniquely identify a person. Information about an individual’s identity can also be inferred based upon their location at various times (in other words, their <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">activities</em> can give away identity information). The other type of information upon which we will focus, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">location information</em>, deals specifically with the whereabouts of an individual or group. We will also describe <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">location-aware applications and services</em> and their relationship with location privacy.</p>
