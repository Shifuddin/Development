                          <p class="Para">With the growing pervasiveness and maturity of fully mobile and wirelessly connected technologies (FMWC), many organizations have begun to equip their field workforce with such information and communication technologies (ICT). The aim of these projects is to automate fieldwork operations, that is, to make them more effective, to improve field force responsiveness, and to speed up the field processes, while using resources and assets more efficiently. In both private and public sectors, such projects have been pursued, yet the specific promises and challenges are not deeply understood. We share early but already robust results from a multi-year research project, which studies the nature and interaction of organizational, social, technological, and human-actor related variables in local government field workforce automation, or short, field force automation (FFA). According to our findings, the ICT-based automation of fieldwork and field workforce appears as a far more demanding undertaking than other successful automation projects. However, the high potential for significant gains in productivity and fieldwork efficacy seem to justify a sumptuous and at times arduous adaptation process.</p>
