                        <p class="Para">Improved support for modeling information systems involving time-varying, georeferenced information, termed spatio-temporal information, has been a longterm user requirement in a variety of areas, such as cadastral systems that capture the histories of landparcels, routing systems computing possible routes of vehicles, and weather forecasting systems. This chapter concerns the conceptual database design phase for such spatio-temporal information systems and presents two models, namely the spatio-temporal Entity Relationship (ER) Model and the Extended spatio-temporal Unified Modeling Language (UML) as proposed in [33,34] and [26], respectively.</p>
