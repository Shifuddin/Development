                          <p class="Para">A policy provisioning framework is described that supports the management of the lifecycle of identity information distributed beyond security domains. A model for creating data handling policies reflecting the intentions of its system administrator and the privacy preferences of the data owner is explained. Also, algorithms for systematically integrating data handling policies from system entities in different administrative domains are presented. This framework enables data handling policies to be properly deployed and enforced in a way that enhances security and privacy.</p>
