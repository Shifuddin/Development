                          <p class="Para">The Internet has proved the enormous benefits that can be accrued to all players involved in online services. However, it has also clearly demonstrated the risks involved in exposing personal data to the outside world and constitutes at the same time a teeming breeding ground of innovation for highly flexible security solutions that can minimize these risks. It is now widely believed that the benefits of online services to healthcare in general supplant the risks involved, provided adequate security measures are taken and the role played by all the parties involved, be they physicians, nurses or patients are clearly outlined. Due to the highly sensitive nature of the data held on the Electronic Health Record (EHR), it is commonly agreed that providing online access to patients EHR to the outside world carries an unacceptable level of risk not only to the patients but also to the healthcare institution that plays a custodian to that sensitive data. However, by sharing these risks with the patients, healthcare institutions can start to equate the possibility of providing controlled exterior online access to patients EHR. The mobile phone is nowadays the preferred mean by which people can interact with each other at a distance. Not only that, the smartphone constitutes the full embodiment of the truly personal device users carry constantly with them, everywhere. They are therefore the ideal means by which the user can casually and conveniently interact with information systems. In this paper we propose a discretionary online access rights management mechanism based on the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model that takes advantage on the personal/technical characteristics and data communications capabilities of the smartphone in order to provide patients with the means by which they can conveniently exercise safe discretionary online access permissions to their own EHR.</p>
