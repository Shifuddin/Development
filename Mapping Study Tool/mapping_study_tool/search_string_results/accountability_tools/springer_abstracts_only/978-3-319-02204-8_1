                        <p class="Para">Tremendous progress has occurred in the past 10â€“20 years in tools that both enable and spring from nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, cognitive science, and interrelated fields. This chapter describes how convergence of these and other emerging technologies is accelerating the advances in scientific knowledge and tool capabilities with relevance to human scale, Earth scale and societal scale activities. Developments are envisioned at the frontiers and interfaces of the foundational converging technologies. Examples of convergence in innovations are seen in cell phones and tablet computers, brain research, novel gene sequencing techniques, means to store and transmit huge amounts of data, novel tools to measure and manipulate objects at the nanoscale, new green and distributed manufacturing models, engineered new materials, expanding interaction between humans and machines, and increasing capabilities for communication and education across distances. With these and other new capabilities is coming the globalization of scientific and engineering R&amp;D at the intersections of traditional disciplines, and an increasingly shared vision of addressing society-wide problems and needs by adapting and applying new tools in transdisciplinary outcomes-focused R&amp;D projects.</p>
