                          <p class="Para">A safe flight starts with effective performance of the pre-flight flight planning and briefing task. However, several problems related to the execution of this task can be identified. Potentially, the introduction of an improved flight plan provides an opportunity to improve the quality and availability of information provided to Flight Crew, thereby enhancing the quality of crew briefings. The proposed risk-based, intelligent flight plan is designed from the perspective of the current operational concept (e.g. fixed routes and ATC managerial role for separation), and associated airline Flight Planning and Dispatch functions. In this case, the focus is sharing information across specific airline stakeholders (e.g. Flight Operations Management and Safety functions) and Maintenance, to support a safe and efficient flight operation. Overall, the introduction of this new flight plan will result in the definition of new operational and organisational processes, along with a new way of performing the pre-flight, planning and briefing task. It is anticipated that this will impact positively on the operational and safety outcome of the flight.</p>
