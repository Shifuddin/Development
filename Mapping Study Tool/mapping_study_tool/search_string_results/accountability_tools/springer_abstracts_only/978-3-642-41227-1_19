                          <p class="Para">Proxy re-encryption (PRE) is an attractive paradigm, which gives good solutions to the problem of delegation of decryption rights. In proxy re-encryption, a semi-trusted proxy translates a ciphertext for Alice into a ciphertext of the same plaintext for Bob, without learning any information of the underlying message. As far as we know, previous PRE schemes are mainly in traditional public key infrastructure or identity-based cryptography, thus they suffer from certificate management problem or key escrow problem in practice. In order to solve these practical problems, we aim at constructing certificateless proxy re-encryption (CL-PRE) schemes.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we first introduce a security definition against (replayable) chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) for certificateless proxy re-encryption. In our security model, the adversary is allowed to adaptively corrupt users (in a specific pattern). Then, we give some evidence that it is not easy to construct a secure CL-PRE. Actually, we present an attack to the chosen plaintext secure CL-PRE scheme proposed by Xu et al. [1]. We also show a novel generic construction for certificateless public key encryption (CL-PKE) can not be trivially adapted to CL-PRE by giving an attack to this generic construction. Finally, we present an efficient CL-PRE scheme and prove its security in the random oracle model based on well-known assumptions.</p>
