                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we first present a scheme called flow-net, which is designed to record events and their relations through the collaboration of the nodes in a network. Flow-net can be used to accomplish accountability and to detect attacks in networks. Then, we present two novel methods to evaluate the accountability of a network via the usersâ€™ accepted overhead (called Q-Accountable Logging by Overhead) and the flow-net record depth (called P-Accountable Logging), respectively. Finally, we study how flow-net records are used to determine whether a potential attack occurs.</p>
