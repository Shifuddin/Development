                          <p class="Para">Security assurance requirements about the security of development environment for IT product or system are described in ALC_DVS (Development Security) family in the part 3 of the Common Criteria (CC). But if the fact the site environment IT products or systems are being developed may meet the requirements of ALC_DVS family is assured by performing an authorized process evaluation criteria like as the SSE-CMM and evaluator recognize that fact, developer can reduce the burden for preparing the site-visiting and evaluator can save the time for site-visit evaluation. In this paper we analyze the compliance between ALC_DVS.1 of the CC and Base Practices (BPs) of the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM), and review the capability level of the SSE-CMM to meet the requirements of ALC_DVS.1</p>
