                            <p class="Para">This paper gives an introduction to an ambitious database project currently running at the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism. The project builds on an extensive database of terrorist incidents dating back to 1968 and adds both content and functionality to make these databases more accessible to researchers. The information on terrorist incidents has been supplemented with information on the organizations responsible, the individual perpetrators, front companies, and monetary sources. The content now being added to the database includes raw historical data from interviews and court documents. This information can provide valuable sociological data for researchers, including how perpetrators were recruited for each attack; their stated motivation; their socio-economic background; what influenced them to join the terrorist organization; etc.</p>
