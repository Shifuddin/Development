                          <p class="Para">The article sets out to pose the question ‘Is it possible for an archive to aid the process of reconciliation?’ Is the scale of a given event, in some cases, insurmountable in terms of reconciling the parties? The graphic nature of the archives and the issue of psychological impact of an archive on the archivist is explored. It is contended that through outreach and dissemination of the contents of the archive, it is possible to provide to the affected communities the information of what the international community has done in terms of judicial redress. Archives can also fulfil-dual roles and this issue is touched upon in that the purpose and organization of the archive is changing from an active records center or a tool of repression to suit a future audience of researchers or to aid reconciliation.</p>
