                          <p class="Para">This paper introduces a model for invisible security. Our model provides an unobtrusive multi-factor authentication and context-aware authorization based on a probabilistic approach that takes into account social relationships and natural behaviors of the user, such as sharing objects or borrowing credentials as a form of access delegation. We believe the traditional model with sequential authentication, authorization and accounting modules is not suitable for smart spaces. Instead we propose a “probabilistic-spiral” model that can be as dynamic as the space itself.</p>
