                          <p class="Para">Both macroappraisal and the Australian records continuum-based DIRKS methodology have been influential in the New Zealand debate on appraisal in recent years. The primary influence of macroappraisal has been in the area of prioritisation of appraisal work. This paper considers New Zealand thinking on prioritisation, and the influences of risk management and functional analysis on this issue. A lack of agreement on the purpose of appraisal in the professional literature is noted, and some personal suggestions are offered on a model taking elements from macroappraisal and other methodologies.</p>
