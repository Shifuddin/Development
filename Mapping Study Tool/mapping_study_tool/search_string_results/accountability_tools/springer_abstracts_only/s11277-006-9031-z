                          <p class="Para">Peer-to-Peer (P2P) has been a major component in raising piracy (or shadow diffusion) over the Internet, similarly Personal Network (PN) will even further enhance the usage of P2P applications. The diffusion of data will be more dynamic as the market structure would change. Piracy of information will still be a major concern due to enhanced usage of P2P based applications, but studies show that piracy has not led to significant loss in welfare. In fact piracy induces awareness across various customer segments and proves to be a more effective means of distribution.</p>
