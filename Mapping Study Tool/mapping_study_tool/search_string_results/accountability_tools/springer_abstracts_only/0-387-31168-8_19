                          <p class="Para">The Internet Protocol version 6 (or IPv6) is designed to replace the current version (IPv4), which is now over 25 years old. Three main categories of social and ethical issues arise in connection with IPv6: issues relating to the right to an IP address, issues related to the application of the technology, and issues related to governance. There are many societal benefits of IPv6, as it will enable once more to have end-to-end security of transmission. Nevertheless, the governance of this deployment now and in the coming years needs to be neutral and controlled, and the governance of the IPv6 Internet that emerges after deployment must be transparent and accountable. Any mistakes we make now will be very costly in terms of loss of existing personal freedoms. This paper will explore these issues.</p>
