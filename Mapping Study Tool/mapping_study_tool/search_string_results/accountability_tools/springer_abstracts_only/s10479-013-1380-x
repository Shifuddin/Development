                        <p class="Para">Trust plays an important role in commercial cloud environments. It is one of the biggest challenges of cloud technology. Trust enables users to select the best resources in a heterogeneous cloud infrastructure. We introduce a novel trust model based on past credentials and present capabilities of a cloud resource provider. Trust value is calculated using four parameters such as availability, reliability, turnaround efficiency, and data integrity. A&nbsp;trust management system is proposed implementing this trust model. The paper describes how a service level agreement is prepared combining quality of service requirements of user and capabilities of cloud resource provider. We also demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than the first in first out model and similar trust models.</p>
