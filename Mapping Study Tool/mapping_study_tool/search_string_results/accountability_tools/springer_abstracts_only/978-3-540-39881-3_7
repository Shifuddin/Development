                          <p class="Para">In this paper, security requirements for software agents and smart devices are derived by working from typical requirements for existing systems, exploring the changes that are envisaged as systems become more highly distributed, then identifying what these imply for a device or service in a pervasive environment. A similar treatment is given to threats, which give rise to both security requirements and design issues. This approach provides insights into security requirements that will be significantly different from todayâ€™s distributed system policies: they demonstrate that pervasive computing requires a qualitative change in security policy and practice. The paper also explores trade-offs between security complexity and device functionality, and argues that the degree of policy management required in a device will be an important factor in this balance.</p>
