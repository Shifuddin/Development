                        <p class="Para">Publish/Subscribe is often regarded as a promising paradigm for Future Internet architectures. Its information oriented nature and its particular security features have stimulated current research efforts which aim at applying publish/subscribe principles to a clean-slate Internet architecture. One of the core components of publish/subscribe architectures is the rendezvous network. Any security failure that a rendezvous network may face will probably jeopardize the operation of the whole (inter-)network. In this paper we highlight security requirements and potential security issues of rendezvous networks and we present security solutions that can be applied in order to shield them.</p>
