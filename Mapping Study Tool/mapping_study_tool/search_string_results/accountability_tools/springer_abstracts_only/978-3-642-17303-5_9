                          <p class="Para">Double-blind peer review is a powerful method to achieve high quality and thus trustworthiness of user-contributed content. Facilitating such reviews requires incentives as well as privacy protection for the reviewers. In this paper, we present the concept of privacy-friendly incentives and discuss the required properties. We then propose a concrete cryptographic realization based on ideas from anonymous e-cash and credential systems. Finally, we report on our softwareâ€™s integration into the MediaWiki software.</p>
