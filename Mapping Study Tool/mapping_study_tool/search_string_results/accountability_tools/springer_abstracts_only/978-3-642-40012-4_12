                          <p class="Para">Sanitizable signatures enable a designated party to modify signed documents in a controlled way, while the derived signature still verifies. In this paper, we introduce the notion of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">non-interactive</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">public</em> accountability. It allows a third party to determine whether a message-signature pair was issued by the signer or the sanitizer. The original notion of accountability does not satisfy European legal standards, while non-interactive public accountability does. A contradictory security goal is the indistinguishability of message-signature pairs from the signer and the sanitizer, a.k.a. transparency. As state-of-the-art schemes often satisfy transparency, they can only achieve a weaker notion of accountability. We show that non-interactive public accountability does not contradict privacy by proving that an existing scheme by Brzuska et al. (BIOSIG â€™09) satisfies both notions. We then extend the scheme to also satisfy <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">blockwise</em> public accountability. Overall, for e-business applications within the EU, opting for non-interactive public accountability can be preferable over transparency.</p>
