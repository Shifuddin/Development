                          <p class="Para">Distributed aggregation algorithms are important in many present and future computing applications. However, after a decade of research, there are still numerous open questions regarding the security of this important class of algorithms. We intend to address some of these questions, mainly those regarding resilience against active attackers, whose aim is to compromise the integrity of the aggregate computation. Our work is currently in its initial stages, but we have identified promising research leads, which we present in this paper.</p>
