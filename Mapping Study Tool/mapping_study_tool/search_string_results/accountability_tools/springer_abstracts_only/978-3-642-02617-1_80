                          <p class="Para">All projects conducted in both the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and the WASC (Web Application Security Consortium) are open-projects in which a company and an individual have voluntarily participated with a vision for web application security. Specifically, these open type projects have studied the web application vulnerabilities and thus have provided their results. Therefore, all these projects can be considered as very influential open-projects. This paper will examine overall introduction of the OWASP and the WASC and then, the major features of their different projects which have been currently conducting as analyzing the similarities and differences between the OWASP and the WASC. Based on the results, the study may suggest a type of synergetic effects from their cooperative work. Finally, with related to the web application security area, this research will discuss about the latest trends in industrial as well academic fields and further directions toward its development.</p>
