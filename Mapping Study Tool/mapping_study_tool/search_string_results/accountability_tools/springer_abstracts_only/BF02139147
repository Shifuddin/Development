                          <p class="Para">Electronic mail, or e-mail, has brought us a big step closer towards the vision of paperless offices. To advance even closer to this vision, however, it is essential that existing e-mail systems be enhanced with value-added services which are capable of replacing many of the human procedures established in pen and paper communications. One of the most important and desirable such services is certified e-mail delivery, in which the intended recipient will get the mail content if and only if the mail originator receives an irrefutable proof-of-delivery from the recipient. In this paper, we present the design of two third-party based certified mail protocols, termed CMP1 and CMP2. Both protocols are designed for integration into existing standard e-mail systems and both satisfy the requirements of<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">nonrepudiation of origin, nonrepudiation of delivery, and fairness</em>. The difference between CMP1 and CMP2 is that the former provides no mail content confidentiality protection while the latter provides such a protection. Moreover, security of the protocols are analyzed using a recently proposed accountability framework.</p>
