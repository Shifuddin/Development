                          <p class="Para">The objective of CARDIAC (Coordinated Action funded by EU’s 7th FP) is to create a platform that can bring together the various stakeholders in the area of accessible and assistive ICT with a view of identifying R&amp;D gaps and emerging trends and generating a research agenda roadmap. The project consists of three pan-European structured dialogues. The consortium organized a virtual structured dialogic design co-laboratory to collect and investigate obstacles that might appear during the three subsequent dialogues to identify potential threats and risks in order to take corrective measures in a timely manner. In response to the Triggering Question “In view of the three upcoming dialogues, what obstacles and threats do you anticipate that might compromise the quality of the outcomes,” they came up with 23 potential threats. The SDD process revealed greatest sensitivity to five.</p>
