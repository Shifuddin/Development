                          <p class="Para">The Internet connects hundreds of millions of computers across the world running on multiple hardware and software platforms providing communication and commercial services. However, this interconnectivity among computers also enables malicious users to misuse resources and mount Internet attacks. The continuously growing Internet attacks pose severe challenges to develop a flexible, adaptive security oriented methods. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of most important component being used to detect the Internet attacks. In literature, different techniques from various disciplines have been utilized to develop efficient IDS. Artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques plays prominent role in development of IDS and has many benefits over other techniques. However, there is no comprehensive review of AI based techniques to examine and understand the current status of these techniques to solve the intrusion detection problems. In this paper, various AI based techniques have been reviewed focusing on development of IDS. Related studies have been compared by their source of audit data, processing criteria, technique used, dataset, classifier design, feature reduction technique employed and other experimental environment setup. Benefits and limitations of AI based techniques have been discussed. The paper will help the better understanding of different directions in which research has been done in the field of IDS. The findings of this paper provide useful insights into literature and are beneficial for those who are interested in applications of AI based techniques to IDS and related fields. The review also provides the future directions of the research in this area.</p>
