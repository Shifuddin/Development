                          <p class="Para">Flexible collaboration is a notable attribute of Web 2.0, which is often in the form of multiple users participating different activities that together complete a whole business process. In such an environment, business processes may be dynamically customized or adjusted, as well as the participants may be selected or attend uncertainly. So how to ensure the legitimacy of a business process for both security and business is increasingly critical. In this paper, we investigate this problem and introduce a novel method to support legally flexible business processes. The proposed Constraint-based Business Process Management Model incorporates constraints into the standard activities composing a business process, where the security constraints place restrictions on participants performing the activities and business constraints restrict the dependencies between multiple activities. By the assembly operations, business processes can be dynamically generated and adjusted with activities, that are obliged to the specified constraints. Several algorithms are presented to verify the consistency of constraints and the soundness of the generated business processes, as well as to perform the execution planning to guarantee the correct execution of a business process on the precondition of satisfying all constraints. We present an illustrative example and implement a prototype for the proposed model that is an application of property rights exchange for supporting legal business processes.</p>
