                        <p class="Para">The issues of logging for determining liability requires to define, prior to a dispute, the logging system and the log analysis in a manner that would determine the parties liable for a predetermined misbehavior of the system. We propose a formal framework for specifying and reasoning about decentralized logs to be used in legal disputes. In addition, we study how previous results can be used in the incremental analysis of larger inputs to obtain precise or approximated results. We illustrate our approach with an example of a travel arrangement service.</p>
