                          <p class="Para">Managing data is a problem of particular importance in trust model of peer-to-peer environments where one frequently encounters unknown agents. Existing methods for data management, which are based on DHT or Random Selection, can not apply well in the unstructured Peer-to-Peer system. They do not scale as they either require additional overhead on maintaining DHT or rely on a central database. In this paper we present an approach that manages trust data through constructing Trust Relationship Network. We quantify performance in terms of number of hits, network overhead, and response time. We use locally maintained network information and former interactions with other peers to improve the performance of searching. We present extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate the performance of our proposed solution.</p>
