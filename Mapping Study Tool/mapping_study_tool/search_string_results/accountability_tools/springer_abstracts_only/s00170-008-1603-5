                          <p class="Para">Efficiency and accuracy are the two main factors that the integrated-circuit (IC) assembly industry must emphasize in order to develop competence. An IC assembly house must keep track of all its wafers, regardless of whether those wafers are in assembly, testing, or shipping; the house must be able to provide clients with instant and accurate information on its products and services. Radio frequency identification (RFID) can collect and alter IC assembly house data electronically. In this study, RFID technology is combined with a RosettaNet network and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system; these elements are applied to resolve various wafer-receiving and inventory transaction problems. An electronic material flow control system is developed using Oracle application implementation methodology (AIM) to integrate RFID technology, the RosettaNet network, and the ERP system. This electronic material flow control system has been implemented at a local IC assembly company. Results from this study suggest that RFID contributes significant improvements to the wafer-receiving process and the inventory transaction process that reduce labor costs and man-made errors. Besides that, our material flow control system greatly reduces operatorsâ€™ workloads and operation costs.</p>
