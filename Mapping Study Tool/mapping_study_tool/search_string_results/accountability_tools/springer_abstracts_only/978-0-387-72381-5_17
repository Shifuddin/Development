                          <p class="Para">This paper will address the British Computer Societyâ€™s (BCS) requirements for accreditation with respect to the content and delivery of professional issues within UK Information Systems and Computing undergraduate degree courses. We shall discuss the professionalism required of BCS members in general, the requirements placed on computing degree programmes by the UK academic authorities and then the specific requirements placed on such courses for them to meet BCS accreditation demands. The major issues that need to be addressed positively by the providers of the programmes will be presented and we will conclude by relating the success of the enterprise to its implementation through the application of self-regulatory and democratic principles.</p>
