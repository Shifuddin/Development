                          <p class="Para">This paper introduces an approach for implementing context-sensitive user-centered scalability (CSUCS) into interactive applications using motion recognition. With scalability we refer to a system’s ability to adapt to the physical and cognitive abilities of a specific user. We discuss an adapted HAAT-model (Human Activity Assistive Technology Model) and the flow concept and show their use in two prototypical implementations: An “exergame” enriching sports exercises for the elderly and an assistive system using gamification elements to enrich the working experience of impaired and elderly persons.</p>
                          <p class="Para">Both systems have in common that they use motion detection and mechanics from game design (gamification). They transparently adapt to and visualize the users’ performance. The real-time analysis of the users’ movements is a prerequisite for the successful implementations of CSUCS.</p>
