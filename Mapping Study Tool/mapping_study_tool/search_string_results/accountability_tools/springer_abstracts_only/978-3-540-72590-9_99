                        <p class="Para">Recently, projects to construct an innovative brand-new city, termed a u-City (ubiquitous City), are being carried out in many countries. The u-City is a future-oriented city which combines ubiquitous information services with city. It has emerged as an alternative for improving the quality of life for human beings and reaching the balanced development among cities. Although a number of privacy problems are anticipated, there are very few researches on the protection of privacy in the u-City. In this study, we describe the privacy guidelines for modern cities as well as the privacy issues in the u-City, and provide suggestions for privacy protection to establish a safe u-City.</p>
