                          <p class="Para">As of now, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">cloud computing</em> has become a hot topic in the global technology industry. Users become able to store their data in cloud storage and have ubiquitous access at any time. In spite of the enormous advantages of cloud storage, one of the greatest challenges is ensuring the security. In this paper, we address the problem of data confidentiality in cloud storage. Further, we consider the portability and secured file sharing issues in cloud storage. Our proposed solution consists of four different modules: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Encryption/Decryption provider (EDP</em>) that performs the cryptographic operations, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Third party auditor (TPA)</em> that traces and audits the EDP, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Keys storage provider (KSP)</em> which performs key management and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Data storage provider (DSP)</em> which stores user files in an encrypted form. We design a prototype to facilitate the process of secured data storage on DSP and KSP. The proposed mechanism ensures the data confidentiality, supports portability, and also provides secured sharing of files among users.</p>
