                          <p class="Para">Provenance is defined in some literature as a complete documentation of process that led to an object. Provenance has been utilized in some contexts, i.e. database systems, file systems and grid systems. Provenance can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this paper we show an access control method to the provenance information that is represented by a directed acyclic graph and a method to improve efficiency of access control by grouping the provenance information. The idea of our model is that by controlling access to nodes, edges and paths in the provenance graph we may build an expressive access control model to the provenance graph. We improve the efficiency of access control model by grouping some provenance information. In our model, the provenance information is stored in a relational database. Before explaining our idea, we describe provenance store, provenance representation, and how to store provenance graph in a relational database.</p>
