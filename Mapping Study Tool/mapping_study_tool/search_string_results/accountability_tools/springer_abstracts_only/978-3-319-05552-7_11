                            <p class="Para">In opening this overview of the statistics of the last 150 years, aiming at researching the social aspects of census surveys and Italian official research, we can represent this set as a stream born in a small scale, extracted in the early years from administrative tasks, and has been enriched through successive inflows becoming a river of a certain size when ISTAT was established, and then a greater river through the help of international institutions. Today we can finally represent the production of social statistics such as the delta of a river (SISTAN) in which each branch (Institutes, administrationâ€¦) contribute to the sediment at the mouth mixing with water (data, information) of others. Three great periods linked to the official statistic can be characterized: the period of the Central Bureau of Statistics (from 1861 to 1926); the period of the Central Statistical Institute (from 1926 to the early 1980s); the period since the early 1980s to the present. Within these periods, it is possible to identify the sub-periods related to events, even outside the official statistics system, but significant in addressing the issues and policies.</p>
