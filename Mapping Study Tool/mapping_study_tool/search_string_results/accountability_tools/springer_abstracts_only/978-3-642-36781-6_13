                          <p class="Para">The energy efficiency aspects of IT infrastructure and communications systems are facing increased scrutiny, and a broad range of compelling financial, social, political and legislative factors is emerging. In this paper, energy efficiency considerations are addressed in the context of BitTorrent. We provide mechanisms to facilitate energy efficiency and energy proportionality, and propose an energy-efficient content distribution system employing these mechanisms to minimise energy consumption and reduce cost.</p>
