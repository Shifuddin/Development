                          <p class="Para">”The world is in chaos – struggling to master its own inventions. We are in danger of being annihilated by forces which we ourselves set up. The world calls for an answer to this problem of mastering our own inventions. And we propose, in 1939, to contribute to that answer.” (Michael Hare, Secretary of the 1939 World’s Fair)</p>
