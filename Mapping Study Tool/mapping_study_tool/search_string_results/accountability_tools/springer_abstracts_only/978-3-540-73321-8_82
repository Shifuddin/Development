                          <p class="Para">Since the 2001 Institute of Medicine Report which estimated that 44,000 to 98,000 patients die each year as a result of healthcare error. This report in effect launched a global patient safety movement, with many proposed regulatory, research and administrative solutions. Patient safety areas of focus such as work complexity, teamwork and communication, technology, and evidence based practice provide a basis for understanding healthcare error. Reliability concepts are the goal of healthcare organizations; and applications such as simulation theory provide means to achieve this status. The translation of research into practice is the foundation of organizational patient safety. Understanding and awareness of patient safety issues has increased; however, significant work to improve patient care outcomes remains.</p>
