                          <p class="Para">User privacy has become a hot topic within the identity management arena. However, the field still lacks comprehensive frameworks even though most identity management solutions include built-in privacy features. This study explores how best to set up a single control point for users to manage privacy policies for their personal information, which may be distributed (scattered) across a set of network-centric identity management systems. Our goal is a user-centric approach to privacy management. As the number of schemas and frameworks is very high, we chose to validate our findings with a prototype based on the Liberty Alliance architecture and protocols.</p>
