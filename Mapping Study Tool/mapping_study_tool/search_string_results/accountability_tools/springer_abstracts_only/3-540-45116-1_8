                          <p class="Para">Service creation for premium IP networks facilitates customized and configured network services dynamically at run time by establishing recursive group communication (event notification) channels between involved service components residing in various network entities. Security, as a feature of danger discovery appears in our service creation design as additional benefit. Same principles of group communication guide us to identify danger patterns in distributed system behaviour and to propagate these patterns to relevant entities for event correlation and reaction.</p>
