                          <p class="Para">This paper discusses the use of wiki technology in higher education. Wikis are simple online information systems which often serve user communities. In higher education, wikis have been used in a supporting function to traditional courses; however, there is little research on wikis taking on a larger role as learning environments. This paper explores how wikis support goals of constructivist learning environments, especially communal constructivism theory. Further, it summarizes results of current research using wikis in the classroom and considers elements which can improve the use of wikis for learning. The paper concludes with a proposal of nine guidelines to improve the use of wiki technology as learning environments in higher education.</p>
