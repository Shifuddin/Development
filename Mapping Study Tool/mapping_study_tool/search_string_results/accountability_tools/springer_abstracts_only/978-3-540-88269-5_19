                            <p class="Para">Optimally micro-aggregating a multivariate data set is known to be NP-hard, thus, heuristic approaches are used to cope with this privacy preserving problem. Unfortunately, algorithms in the literature are computationally costly, and this prevents using them on large data sets.</p>
                            <p class="Para">We propose a partitioning algorithm to micro-aggregate uniform very large data sets with cost <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>). We provide the mathematical foundations proving the efficiency of our algorithm and we show that the error associated to micro-aggregation is bounded and decreases when the number of micro-aggregated records grows. The experimental results confirm the prediction of the mathematical analysis. In addition, we provide a comparison between our proposal and MDAV, a well-known micro-aggregation algorithm with cost <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">O</em>(<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em>
