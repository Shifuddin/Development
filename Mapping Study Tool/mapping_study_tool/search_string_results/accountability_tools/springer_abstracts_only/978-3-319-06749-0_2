                          <p class="Para">This paper points out the importance of architecture in designing a privacy-by-design system. It provides an overview on how architectures are designed, analysed and evaluated, through quality attributes, tactics and architecture patterns. It then specifies a straw man architecture design methodology for privacy. The resulting PEAR (Privacy Enhancing ARchitecture) methodology is then illustrated through an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Intelligent Transport systems</em> (ITS) example application. The integration of the resulting methodology in a Privacy-by-Design process is then explained. Suggestions for future work that will lead to an agreed engineering practice are finally provided.</p>
