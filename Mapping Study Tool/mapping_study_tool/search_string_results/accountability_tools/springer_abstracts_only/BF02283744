                          <p class="Para">This paper describes and evaluates three different approaches to building decision support systems: the Operations Research/Management Science approach, the Decision Analysis/Multiattribute Utility approach, and the Artificial Intelligence/Expert Systems approach. It evaluates the usefulness of the three approaches for risk management. In particular, it defines evaluation objectives of risk analysts, risk managers, and laypeople and provides a subjective assessment how the three approaches stack up against their objectives. The paper concludes that for most risk management applications a combination of the three approaches would be most desirable.</p>
