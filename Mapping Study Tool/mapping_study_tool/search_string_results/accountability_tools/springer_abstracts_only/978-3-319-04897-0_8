                          <p class="Para">Malleable signature schemes (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathcal MSS\)</span>) enable a third party to alter signed data in a controlled way, maintaining a valid signature after an authorized change. Most well studied cryptographic constructions are (1) redactable signatures (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2">\(\mathcal RSS\)</span>), and (2) sanitizable signatures (<span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3">\(\mathcal SSS\)</span>). <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4">\(\mathcal RSS\)</span>s allow the removal of blocks from a signed document, while <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5">\(\mathcal SSS\)</span>s allow changing blocks to arbitrary strings. We rigorously prove that <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6">\(\mathcal RSS\)</span>s are less expressive than <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7">\(\mathcal SSS\)</span>s: no unforgeable <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq8">\(\mathcal RSS\)</span> can be transformed into an <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq9">\(\mathcal SSS\)</span>. For the opposite direction we give a black-box transformation of a single <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq10">\(\mathcal SSS\)</span>, with tightened security, into an <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq11">\(\mathcal RSS\)</span>.</p>
