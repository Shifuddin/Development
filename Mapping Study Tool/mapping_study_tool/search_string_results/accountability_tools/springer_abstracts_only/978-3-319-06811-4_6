                            <p class="Para">In 2004 the series of annual Secure Data Management workshops as part of VLDB began, so SDM can now celebrate its 10<sup>th</sup> edition. It is less clear, when research in the area of security began; even for ICT security this is unclear. One could claim, that security research started thousands of years ago, when the original Trojan Horse was designed. While one can probably find even earlier references to research on security issues, referring to the Trojan Horse can also take its justification from the fact, that the original Trojan Horse lead to a decisive end of a security issue after about 10&nbsp;years. In any case it illustrates, that already several millennia of thinking (or not-thinking) were spent on the issue. Therefore this text starts with a description of relevant goals (1) as well as technical and other trends (2). Then (3) relevant instruments for ICT security are derived from the goals and trends. These instruments are not necessarily new but important for research due to their relevance in general or due to their high number of relevant open questions.</p>
