                          <p class="Para">The current trend in designing Health Information Systems is to apply federated architectures by integrating existing systems. This exacerbates the security guarantees that such systems are required to satisfy and demands the introduction of advanced methods for dealing with security. This paper aims at describing how federated Health Information Systems can offer security properties by adopting proper mechanisms to protect exchanged data and provided functionalities from malicious manipulations.</p>
