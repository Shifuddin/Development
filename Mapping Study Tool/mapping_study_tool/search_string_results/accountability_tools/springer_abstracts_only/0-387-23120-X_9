                          <p class="Para">IFIP (International Federation for Information Processing) has been working on professional codes of deontology for the last 10 years. Lessons have been derived from that experience and most probably are also applicable in the more general field of engineering, especially when related to the Information Society. Today there is an emphasis on instruments of self-regulation in a society where it is said that legal instruments are territorial and not global. IFIP-Special Interest Group 9.2.2 has proposed a classification and has made an analysis of some of these instruments. Specific domains come forward when building a framework for regulating the Information Society. Professional deontological statements in most cases show an ethical preoccupation. The question may be raised whether this is to protect customers, clients or citizens, or whether this is for self-protection. How to implement these ethical considerations and instruments remains a challenge to be examined in the framework of the World Summit on the Information Society.</p>
