                          <p class="Para">Mobile ad hoc networks rely on the co-operation of devices that route for each other. This immediately presents security problems. Each device's data passes through the not so friendly hands of other devices. Forwarding devices must use their processing power and battery power to route packets for others. When bandwidth is limited they must also use bandwidth that they might want to use for themselves. These are not great issues with the first incarnations of ad hoc networks â€” military systems or others where all the devices are owned by a single organisation. However, if ad hoc networks are to be generally deployed and become an alternative or adjunct to future cellular systems, then ways to encourage co-operation are required.</p>
