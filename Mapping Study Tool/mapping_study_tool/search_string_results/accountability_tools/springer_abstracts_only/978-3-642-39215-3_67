                          <p class="Para">The burgeoning use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) has required the rapid response of stakeholders to identify best practices in the selection and training of UAS operators and managers. This paper examines the Knowledge, Skills, Attitudes, and Other aspects (KSAs/KSAOs) that have been identified as necessary of UAS operators. Historical studies on KSAs are outlined and commonalities in KSAs among UAS platforms are identified. Further, best practices for KSA enhancement training, such as Simulation Based Training (SBT) and Scenario Based Training (ScBT), are described. Example training scenario development is provided as is a sample training event utilizing the outlined practices is given.</p>
