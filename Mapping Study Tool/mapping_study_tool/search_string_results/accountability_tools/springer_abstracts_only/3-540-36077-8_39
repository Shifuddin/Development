                          <p class="Para">Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional strategy that focuses on critical reasoning to achieve a high degree of student engagement. PBL is an example of rich environments for active learning (REAL). REALs are comprehensive instructional systems that promote study and investigation within authentic contexts; encourage the growth of student engagement and responsibility, decision making, and intentional learning; cultivate collaboration among students and teachers; utilize dynamic, interdisciplinary, generative learning activities that promote higher-order thinking processes to help students develop rich and complex knowledge structures; and, assess student progress in content and learning-to-learn within authentic contexts using realistic tasks and performances. In this chapter, we compare existing assumptions underlying education with new assumptions that promote problem solving and higher-level thinking.</p>
