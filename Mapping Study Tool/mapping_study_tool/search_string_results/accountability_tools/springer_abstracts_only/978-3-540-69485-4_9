                          <p class="Para">Real world healthcare systems are generally large and overly complex systems. Designing privacy-friendly protocols for such systems is a challenging task. In this paper we present a privacy-preserving protocol for the Belgian healthcare system. The proposed protocol protects the patientsâ€™ privacy throughout the prescription handling process, while complying with most aspects of the current Belgian healthcare practise. The presented protocol relies on standard privacy-preserving credential systems, and verifiable public key cryptography, which makes it readily fit for implementation.</p>
