                        <p class="Para">Protecting individual sensitive specific information has become an area of concern over the past one decade. Several techniques like <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k-</em>anonymity and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">l</em>-diversity employing generalization/suppression based on concept hierarchies (CHTS) were proposed in literature. The anonymization effectiveness depends on the CHT chosen from the various CHTS possible for a given attribute. This paper proposes a model for constructing dynamic CHT for numerical attributes which can be: 1) generated on the fly for both generalization/suppression; 2) dynamically adjusted based on a given <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">k</em>. The anonymized data using our method yielded 12% better utility when compared to existing methods. The results obtained after experimentation support our claims and are discussed in the paper.</p>
