                          <p class="Para">This research paper focuses on the security of strategic information during the hiring process. &nbsp;Information control and communication channel vulnerabilities are identified through the process-based risk assessment and human factor analysis. A control procedure is proposed to address these security concerns through system design and information flow improvements in the recruitment process. This proposed control procedure can also serve as a base model for different human resource functions to integrate and create uniformity in risk mitigation to maximize and streamline the managementâ€™s efforts and resources in managing the information related risks in different human resource processes.</p>
