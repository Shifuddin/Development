                          <p class="Para">Genetic algorithms are popular for service selection as they deliver good results in short time. However, current approaches do not consider compliance rules for single tasks in a process model. To address this issue, we present an approach for compliance-aware service selection with genetic algorithms. Our approach employs the notion of compliance distance to detect and recover violations and can be integrated into existing genetic algorithms by means of a repair operation. As a proof-of-concept, we present a genetic algorithm incorporating our approach and compare it with related state-of-the-art genetic algorithms lacking this kind of check and recovery mechanism for compliance.</p>
