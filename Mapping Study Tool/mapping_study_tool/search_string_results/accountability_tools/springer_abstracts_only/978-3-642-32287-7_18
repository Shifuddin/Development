                          <p class="Para">This paper relies on a UML profile with a graphical concrete syntax for the design of secure data warehouses. The UML extensions define security concepts to adopt the RBAC and MAC standards, to define conflicts of interests, and to model multidimensional schemas. In addition, this profile has formal semantics defined in Prolog that provides for the verification of both the design well-formedness and the coherence of security policies of data warehouse designs.</p>
