                          <p class="Para">The open data availability, promoted by the open government approach, does not correspond to an effective and organized use of them with the detriment of both citizens and PAs. We assume that a data visualization tool could help the spread of information in an easy and accessible way, even for what concerns open data. In this paper we will focus on the map, as one of the most suitable tools for the interactive representation of spatial related data. So, we will present the Roma Crash Map platform, a web application that allows to visualize the road crashes open data related to the 19 Municipalities of the city of Rome. In details, we will report the considerations about the selection and design of the visualization tools, according to the purpose to familiarize the users with participating tools integrating maps or more complex geographical systems.</p>
