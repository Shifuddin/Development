                          <p class="Para">This paper investigates criminal sentencing in the Australian State of Victoria in particular the intuitive nature of the decision making and the difficulties of representing intuitive knowledge. In order for decision systems to be useful for the purposes of training novice practitioners and law students in the complex area of sentencing they must be constructed with an authentic cognitive model that faithfully represents the sentencing process and also the decision-making process. In this paper a pre-cognitive model of the sentencing process is presented.</p>
