                          <p class="Para">In this paper we explore pseudo-random number generation on the IBM 4758 Secure Crypto Coprocessor. In particular we compare several variants of Gennaroâ€™s provably secure generator, proposed at Crypto 2000, with more standard techniques based on the <strong class="EmphasisTypeBold ">SHA-1</strong> compression function. Our results show how the presence of hardware support for modular multiplication and exponentiation affects these algorithms.</p>
