                          <p class="Para">The current era of Information, Communication and Media Technologies (ICMT) has ushered in the era of eBusiness and the Information Society where traditional managerial paradigms are challenged and new business models are sought. One central area of managerial discourse is STRATEGY. Based upon a pilot study with leading European managers, consultants and academics, we offer a structured perspective on what may be the shape of things to come for STRATEGIC PLANNING in the context of eBusiness and the Information Society. Normative implications are explored.</p>
