                          <p class="Para">Gone are days when every thing related to “e” must be western or related to developed countries. There were times not long ago, when India was considered a country of snake charmers. With technological revolution, India has been the front runner in the area of Information Technology. India’s matured and robust educational system provided the much-needed backbone to IT manpower needs in country and abroad.
