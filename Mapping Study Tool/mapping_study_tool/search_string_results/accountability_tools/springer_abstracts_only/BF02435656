                          <p class="Para">Information seeking is part of information science, and its aim is to study how people seek and use information in their work, for what purpose the information is sought, how this information influences the effectiveness of the work and what barriers people perceive in their search for, and use of, necessary information. This study examines information seeking in pre-trial police investigation. There has been no previous attempt to examine information seeking in pre-trial police investigation, of the earlier studies in information seeking only those concerning lawyers represent a somewhat similar field. In both fields the work is subject to confidentiality, which is strictly regulated by law. This study was carried out partly in cooperation with another study, which examines documentation in pre-trial investigation. During the research project it became obvious that information seeking with its different components is something also to be taken into account in documentation and records management.</p>
