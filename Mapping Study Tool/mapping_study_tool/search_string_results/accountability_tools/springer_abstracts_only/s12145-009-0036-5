                          <p class="Para">While commercial virtual globes (e.g. Google Earth) and global scientific cyber-infrastructures (e.g. Digital Earth) are revolutionizing the way we use and produce geo-information, we still lack a rich conceptual understanding of how genuine human actors use geo-information and associated technologies in real work settings. In this paper, we conceptualize the use of geo-information as encompassing peopleâ€™s actual use <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">practices</em>, the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">values</em> to which people aspire through geo-information use, and the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">rules</em> that either legally prescribe or just encourage optimal use. Values, practices and rules can be illuminated from two perspectives (or lenses), the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">market</em> and the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">polis</em>, resulting in radically different insights on the use of geo-information as a social phenomenon. We argue that with a polis lens we stand a chance to explain how authentic human actors, groups and communities with different values, interests and motivations use geo-information, and how societal benefits materialize or not as a result. Seen from a polis lens, values are not easily measurable standards of goodness, dominant public management ideas can be the source of technical-organizational change in government while policies can be fruitfully examined as persuasive arguments to target audiences. With a polis lens, we are more likely to understand the emergence of new practices, value contests and global rules underpinning commercial virtual globes and scientific cyber-infrastructures.</p>
