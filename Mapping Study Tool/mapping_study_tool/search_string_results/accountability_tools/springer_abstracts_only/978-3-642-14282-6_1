                          <p class="Para">The design of identity management preserving an individual’s privacy must not stop at supporting the user in managing her/his present identities. Instead, since any kind of privacy intrusion may have implications on the individual’s future life, it is necessary that we identify and understand the issues related to longterm aspects of privacy-enhancing identity management. Only that way, according solutions can be developed, which enable users to control the disclosure of their personal data throughout their whole lives, comprising past, present, and future.</p>
                          <p class="Para">This paper will give a general overview about concepts supporting privacy-enhancing identity management. Further, it introduces the reader to the problem field of privacy management by means of privacy-enhancing identity management during various stages of life as well as in various areas of life. Statements about required mechanisms will be given as well as directions regarding the three most important aspects to consider when managing one’s identities: communication infrastructure as well as selection of communication partners and tools.</p>
