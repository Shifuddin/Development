                          <p class="Para">The National Science Foundation and DELOS , the European Commission sponsored Network for Digital Libraries, supported a working group to define a research agenda for digital archiving and preservation (DAP-WG) within the context of digital libraries. The report of this group, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Invest to Save</em>, has laid out a range of research challenges that need to be addressed if we are to make progress in the development of sustainable digital libraries. DAP-WG considered archiving and preservation needs and the research that had been conducted to address these. It concluded that research in this domain could benefit from being expanded and refocusedâ€”new research communities must be engaged, the approaches to conducting the research must be made more rigorous, and a significant shift in what was being researched needed to be taken. The Group identified twenty-two key research activities worthy of investigation. </p>
