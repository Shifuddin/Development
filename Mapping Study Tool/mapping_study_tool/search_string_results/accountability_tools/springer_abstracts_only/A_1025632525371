                          <p class="Para">E-business environments pose unique challenges to the measurement of information technology payoff. In this paper we discuss some of those challenges as stemming from issues such as the productivity paradox, level of measurement, choice of metrics and the process of measurement. Further, we discuss those characteristics that make investments in E-business environment different from other types of IT investment. In doing so, we draw upon the contribution of the papers in this special issue of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Information Systems Frontiers</em> and conclude with our proposal for areas where further research needs to be conducted.</p>
