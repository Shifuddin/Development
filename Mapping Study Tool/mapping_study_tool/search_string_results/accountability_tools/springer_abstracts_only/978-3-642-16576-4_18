                          <p class="Para">In recent years, with the rapid proliferation of new computing technologies, a variety of new computing environments have been introduced, such as decentralisation and mobility. The traditional security mechanisms are seen to be inadequate for these new environments. Trust is applied as a “soft security” to cope with new security concerns. Much research on trust systems has been carried out, it is important to identify the reliability of computational trust in different computing scenarios in order to make an enhancement. The reliability of trust systems for securing social interaction is demonstrated by showing the performance of the three trust-based systems under various scenarios in a pervasive computing environment. The focus of this paper is on enhancing trust-based systems and proposing a novel monitor model which supplements existing trust models.</p>
