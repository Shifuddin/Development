                        <p class="Para">In this chapter the research problems of specifying and negotiating QoS and its corresponding quality documents are analyzed. For this reason, this chapter is separated into two main sections, Section&nbsp;6.1 and&nbsp;6.2, with each dedicated to one of the two problems, i.e., QoS specification and negotiation, respectively. Each section has a similar structure: they first introduce the problem and then, in the remaining subsections, review related work. Finally, the chapter ends with Section&nbsp;6.3, which identifies research gaps and presents potential research challenges in QoS modelling, specification and negotiation.</p>
