                          <p class="Para">Unauthorized access and illegal content distribution cause huge revenue loss to the rights holders. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a system, which is developed to prevent illegal content consumption. To ensure authorized content consumption, most of the existing DRM systems lose consumer privacy. However, a scalable DRM system should maintain secure and flexible content distribution which can protect privacy without losing accountability. In this article, we present a secure content distribution mechanism in which involve parties mutually authenticate each other and establish secure session which offers promise for secure content delivery. Moreover, content delivery mechanism does not reveal consumers’ preferences and system learns nothing except what must be learned to achieve accountability, which ensures consumers’ privacy.</p>
