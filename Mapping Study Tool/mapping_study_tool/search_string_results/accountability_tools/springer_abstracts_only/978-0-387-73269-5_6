                          <p class="Para">Most traditional software development methodologies do not explicitly include a standardised method for incorporating information security into their life cycles. It is argued that security considerations should provide input into every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from requirements gathering to design, implementation, testing and deployment. Therefore, to build more secure software applications, an improved software development process is required. The Secure Software Development Model (SecSDM), as described in this paper, is based on many of the recommendations provided by relevant international standards and best practices, for example, the ISO 7498-2 (1989) standard which addresses the underlying security services and mechanisms that form an integral part of the model.</p>
