                          <p class="Para">Service designers and developers, while striving to meet the requirements posed by application scenarios, have a hard time to assess the trust and security impact of an option, a minor change, a combination of functionalities, etc., due to the subtle and unforeseeable situations and behaviors that can arise from this panoply of choices. This often results in the release of flawed products to end-users. This issue can be significantly mitigated by empowering designers and developers with tools that offer easy to use graphical interfaces and notations, while employing established verification techniques to efficiently tackle industrial-size problems. The formal verification of trust and security of the Internet of Services will significantly boost its development and public acceptance.</p>
