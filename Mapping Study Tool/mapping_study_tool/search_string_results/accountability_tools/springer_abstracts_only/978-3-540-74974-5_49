                            <p class="Para">In order to increase IT and business agility or to improve IT systems and business processes integration many organizations are currently implementing business process management systems (BPMS) or adopting a service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. However, in doing so, IT complexity will admittedly increase and IT managers then are in need of effective governance techniques covering both strategic initiatives, BPM and SOA. This contribution re-examines the problem domain in the novel <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Enhanced Process-Driven Architecture</em> (ePDA) model in order to systematically derive the requirements for combined BPM and SOA governance. We then formulate a semantic meta model capable of capturing necessary artifacts and describe its technical implementation in Software AG’s and Fujitsu’s joint CentraSite governance re gis try/repository. As "lessons learned" from several projects we systematically derive governance benefits using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and highlight measures on software deployment issues.</p>
