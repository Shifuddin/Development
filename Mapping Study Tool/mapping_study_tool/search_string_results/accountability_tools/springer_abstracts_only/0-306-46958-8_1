                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we define a language for specifying security protocols concisely and unambiguously. We use this language to formally specify the protocol for payment transactions in Secure Electronic Transaction (SET), which has been developed by Visa and MasterCard.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In our language, a protocol is specified as a collection of processes. Each process expresses the role of a participant. In the role-based specification, the components that a participant sees in a message can be stated explicitly. This is important in specifying protocols like that for the SET payment transactions because in such protocols some message components are encrypted and invisible to some participants.</p>
                          <p class="Para">We simplify the SET payment transaction protocol into the exchanges of six messages. Because our future goal is to formally analyze the security properties that Meadows and Syverson discussed, we make the simplified protocol contain the parameters used in their security properties. And we also refrain from excessive simplification. For example, we use dual signature in the payment request message as it is specified in the SET specification books, while most of the other works do not use it. Our specification can serve as a starting point for a formal analysis of the protocol.</p>
