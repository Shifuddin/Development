                        <p class="Para">When an analysis is made of security standardisation activities around the world, it is quickly appreciated that we are in fact well away from realising an optimum approach to security standards development. However, there is still much to be gained from the standardisation process. This paper looks at the range of security standardisation activities, and then focuses on the work being done to develop generic (basic) security building block standards in the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 27. The range of Subcommittee 27 activities is summarised, and an update is given of progress to date. This status is then placed in the perspective of related Australian standardisation activity.</p>
