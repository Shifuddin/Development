                          <p class="Para">Obligations are pervasive in modern systems, often linked to access control decisions. We present a very general model of obligations as objects with state, and discuss its interaction with a programâ€™s execution. We describe several analyses that the model enables, both static (for verification) and dynamic (for monitoring). This includes a systematic approach to approximating obligations for enforcement. We also discuss some extensions that would enable practical policy notations. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our model against standard definitions from jurisprudence.</p>
