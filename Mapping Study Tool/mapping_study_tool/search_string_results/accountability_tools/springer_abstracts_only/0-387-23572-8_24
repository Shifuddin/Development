                          <p class="Para">This paper describes a system of Program Quality Assurance that has acted to improve the quality of e-training programs in an Australian university. It is based on the use of quality cycles, and was devised to enhance the quality of all of the universityâ€™s programs. This paper is based on research involving interviews with stakeholders in this system and, amongst other things, uncovered some mistakes that had been made in the initial systems implementation that resulted in a number of academic staff distrusting the system. The paper suggests that better training could have reduced these problems. It argues that the use of this system, despite these implementation problems, has been seen by most stakeholders as an important contributor to improving the quality of e-training systems, rather than just measuring them.</p>
