                          <p class="Para">This paper investigates the demand for ICT shared services in Irish local government, why has the take-up to date been so limited and what the barriers to adoption are historically and are today. The research shows that there is an apparent large demand for ICT shared services from all local authorities, but that in practice take-up is low and there is a strong preference for local solutions over national offerings. A number of barriers to adoption are identified and discussed.</p>
