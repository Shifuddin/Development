                        <p class="Para">This paper focuses on outsourcing IT and Business Processes, with the added dimension of the provider of the service being ’offshore’ or in a different geography. Highlighting the unique characteristics of the Lean Governance model, the paper stresses the importance of moving outsourcing status from customer-vendor to being partners in attaining enterprise goals. Explaining the concept through case studies, the author demonstrates the importance of structures and processes, as organizations become more mature in the outsourcing process and as business imperatives change. The Lean Governance model encompasses these very elements, and is therefore a force multiplier for achieving the outsourcing objectives of both business and IT dimensions.</p>
