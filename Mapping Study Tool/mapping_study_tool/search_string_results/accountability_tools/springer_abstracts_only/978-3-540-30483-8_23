                          <p class="Para">Grid computing has emerged as a special form of distributed computing and is distinguished from conventional distributed computing by its focus on dynamic, large-scale resource sharing over a wide geographic distribution. Grid Computing System (GCS) is a distributed system infrastructure over which distributed applications with cross-organization resource sharing are operated. Grid applications are modelled by the notion of virtual organization which is generally composed of participants from different organizations driven by specific tasks. In order to control participation and access to shared resource, authorization is essential in VO. Authorization in VO is challenging because of the dynamic and distributed nature of VO. A community authorization service (CAS) was proposed recently to meet the Grid challenges and to enforce fine-grained access control policies in the VO. However, the situation is aggravated when VO is used to model business application systems such as financial systems of commercial enterprises where security and accountability are of key concerns. The emphasis on separation of duties in business applications only make things worse. This paper aims to address these authorization issues when the GCS is used to support business applications. In this paper, we introduce the use of threshold closure as a tool for enhancing the CAS in order for the Grid to better support commercial VO.</p>
