                        <p class="Para">Service Engineering and Design (SED) aims at establishing, understanding and managing the entire service lifecycle, including identifying, finding, designing, developing, deploying, evolving, quality assuring, and maintaining services. SED principles, techniques and methods interweave and exploit the mechanisms provided by the S-Cube technology stack with the aim of developing high-quality service-based systems. For example, the SED plane provides specifications to the BPM and SAM layers that can guide the service composition and coordination layer in composing services in a manner that guarantees that the composition behaves as expected.</p>
                        <p class="Para">This chapter focuses on the analysis of existing life cycle approaches for adaptable and evolvable service-based applications with an emphasis on how the lack of a life cycle that can handle adaptation lead to the definition of a reference service life cycle for the development of adaptable service based applications. This chapter also identifies the main concepts, issues, and challenges concerning the various phases of our reference life cycle as they have been identified in the literature.</p>
