                          <p class="Para">Beginning with the motivations for scrutability, this paper introduces PLUS, a vision of Pervasive Lifelong User-models that are Scrutable. The foundation for PLUS is the Accretion/Resolution representation for active user models that can drive adaptive hypermedia, with support for scrutability. The paper illustrates PLUS in terms of its existing, implemented elements as well as some examples of applications built upon this approach. The concluding section is a research agenda for essential elements of this PLUS vision.</p>
