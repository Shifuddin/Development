                          <p class="Para">Mobile IPv6 runs high risk of being attacked by IP spoofing due to the introduction of mobility and route optimization. In this paper, an authentic IP address validation scheme is proposed to protect mobile nodes in Mobile IPv6 against IP spoofing attack. The mobile nodesâ€™ historical traffic information is leveraged to validate the authenticity of its claimed home address in the scheme. Compared with other authentication schemes, this scheme is much simpler to implement and easier to deploy based on the usage of real data, and does not require additional computational overhead. It also solves the address ownership problem and the unauthenticated binding update issue in Mobile IPv6. Real traces are used to demonstrate the applicability of the scheme in this paper. The experimental results show that only three consecutive historical packet records are required to construct a unique authentication key, which can identify forged home address efficiently.</p>
