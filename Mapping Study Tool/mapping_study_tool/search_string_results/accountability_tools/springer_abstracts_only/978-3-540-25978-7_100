                          <p class="Para">Different IT applications require different network and application security services. We have been working in the area of e-health applications in mobile environments, and we have needed to integrate security services therein. This paper presents a&nbsp;specification of such network and application security services for mobile e-health applications and how we have implemented them. First, various security threats specific of e-health applications are described, like patients’ data eavesdropping and manipulation. The different security mechanisms to address these specific security threats are then described, e.g., data confidentiality and integrity. Following, the specification of the network and application security requirements and the implementation possibilities to address them in the mobile e-health applications are described. As an example of network and application security services integrated into an e-health system, the paper includes the description of the mobile e-health application MobiHealth, an application developed within the European Commission co-funded MobiHealth project (IST–2001–36006), focusing on the security services added to it.</p>
