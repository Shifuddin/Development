                        <p class="Para">Recently, Xia et al.&nbsp;proposed a variant of Prêt à Voter which enjoys several attractive properties. Their protocol is among the few verifiable and receipt-free paper-based voting protocols resistant against randomization attacks. Trust is distributed among several authorities and the voter interface is relatively simple. Also, approval and ranked elections are supported.</p>
                        <p class="Para">In this paper, we improve and simplify the protocol by Xia et al. Among others, we propose a simpler way of producing ballots, which only involves the encryption and re-encryption of candidate names; homomorphic encryption and proxy re-encryption are not needed. Also, no machine involved in the production of ballots needs to store a secret key. Moreover, unlike the protocol by Xia et al., in our protocol all authorities can be held accountable in case they misbehave in an observable way.</p>
