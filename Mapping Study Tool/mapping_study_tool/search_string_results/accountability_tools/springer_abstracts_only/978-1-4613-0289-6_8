                        <p class="Para">This chapter considers the increasing complexity of internal and external influences on organisational management and behaviour, with a specific focus on poor communications within the psychosocial working environment. It is argued that different management approaches impact in different ways on the wellbeing of the workforce and ultimately on levels of performance. As a consequence, some organisations may need to address their management styles and communications strategies, before they are able to embrace the concepts of knowledge sharing and knowledge management in practice.</p>
                        <p class="Para">An empirical investigation of a higher education institution suggests that the management of change is a significant contributory factor to wellbeing and performance. Further exploration identified the impact that people have on organisational competitiveness and performance. Recommendations were made that could contribute to the development of an appropriate Human Resource strategy and a participative and interactive change management model was developed, In particular, a good communications strategy was seen as vital, and such a strategy should, in todayâ€™s environment, be geared towards knowledge sharing.</p>
