A classification of the generic <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TTP</em> concept is then detailed with legal and technical considerations and three forms and variants of such <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TTPs</em> are distinguished. Anonymisation techniques are described that can be applied for privacy requirements that can be expressed by the healthcare area and reusable by any other sector. After some recommendations on the interoperability of such <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">TTP</em> architectures, it is extracted, from all these theoretical concepts and some mentioned applied projects of the healthcare sector, a framework for a global approach towards more secure and more dependable health information systems and exchanges.</p>
