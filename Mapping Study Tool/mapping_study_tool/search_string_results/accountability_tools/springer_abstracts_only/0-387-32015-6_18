                        <p class="Para">With the increasing complexity of networked systems has come the trade-off of security versus functionality; a strictly secured system is often an unusable system. As a consequence, users often entirely bypass security in order to get their job done. We consider how similarity techniques that are used by case-based reasoning systems can be used to provide a degree of control over how strictly/precisely security is enforced. The flexibility to be able to meaningfully control how strictly security is enforced is especially relevant in the emerging Web Services architectures, where a wide variety of different users and heterogeneous systems use a common framework to interoperate with a wide variety of different resources and services. The paper proposes <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">similarity-based imprecision security</em> (SBIS) for the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Security Assertion Markup Language</em> (SAML) as an approach to managing security in a web-services environment.</p>
