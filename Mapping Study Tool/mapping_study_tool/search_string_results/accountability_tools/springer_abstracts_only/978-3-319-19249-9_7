                            <p class="Para">The work presented in this paper is the result of a collaboration between academics, industry and lawyers to show the applicability of the privacy by design approach to biometric systems and the benefit of formal methods to this end. The choice of particular techniques and the role of the components (central server, secure module, terminal, smart card, etc.) in the architecture have a strong impact on the privacy guarantees provided by a biometric system. However, existing proposals were made on a case by case basis, which makes it difficult to compare them and to provide a rationale for the choice of specific options. In this paper, we show that a general framework for the definition of privacy architectures can be used to specify these options and to reason about them in a formal way.</p>
