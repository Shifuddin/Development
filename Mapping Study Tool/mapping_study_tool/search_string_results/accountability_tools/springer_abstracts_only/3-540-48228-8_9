                            <p class="Para">This paper presents the architecture of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Virtual Laboratory Abstract-Machine</em> (VL-AM), a data and process handling system on the Grid. This system has been developed within the context of the Virtual Laboratory (VL) project, which aims at building an environment for experimental science. The VL-AM solves problems commonly faces when addressing process and data handling in a heterogeneous environment. Although existing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Grid technologies</em> already provide suitable solutions most of the time, considerable knowledge and experience outside of the application domain is often required. The VL-AM makes these grid technologies readily available to a broad community of scientists.</p>
                            <p class="Para">Moreover, it extends the current data Grid architecture by introducing an object-oriented database model handling complex queries on scientific information.</p>
