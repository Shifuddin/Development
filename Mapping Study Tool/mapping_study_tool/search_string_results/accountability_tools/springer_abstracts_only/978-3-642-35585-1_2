                        <p class="Para">In this paper, we propose a review of the mechanisms and procedures to securely manage vertical handovers in heterogeneous networks. The purpose of the paper is to position the heterogeneous networks in the context of wireless security and to describe the possible attacks that come along with this new kind of infrastructure. From a critical analysis of the literature, this paper focuses on the new security challenges that surround the different entities involved in the handover management.</p>
