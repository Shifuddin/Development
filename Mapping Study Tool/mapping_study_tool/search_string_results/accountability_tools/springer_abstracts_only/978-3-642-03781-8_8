                          <p class="Para">This study on e-participation is based on a project led by the Emilia Romagna region in collaboration with other Italian public administrations. This project has been investigated turning to a twofold perspective: the e-participation kit enhancement and its actual implementation. A temporary collaboration of involved public administrations and the putting together of already existing technological devices provided by implicated administrations have composed this ad hoc technological solution (an assemblage). The analysis of the kit implementation gives way to an understanding of reality based on sense of ‘content’ (objects, people, physical and temporal circumstances etc.), sense of ‘relation’ (network of meanings and references among objects, people, physical and temporal circumstances etc.) and sense of ‘actualisation’ (how sense of ‘content’ and sense of ‘relation’ have been enacted and made active) representing a tentative attempt to introduce also factors such as existential disposition and mood in the study of this e-participation kit implementation.</p>
