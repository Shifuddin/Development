                          <p class="Para">Shared care requires open distributed information systems for supporting communication and co-operation. Regarding the sensitive character of personal medical information, such communication and co-operation must be provided securely. Meeting the European as well as national legislation, several projects such as ISHTAR, TrustHealth, MEDSEC, EUROMED-ETS, and HARP have been launched by the European Commission for specifying, implementing and evaluating appropriate security solutions. Based on the mentioned projectsâ€™ results, a trustworthy shared care infrastructure is discussed in the paper.</p>
