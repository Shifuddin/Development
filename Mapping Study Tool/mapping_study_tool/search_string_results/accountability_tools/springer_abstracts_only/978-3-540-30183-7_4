                          <p class="Para">In the hope of stimulating discussion, we present a heuristic decision tree that designers can use to judge how suitable a P2P solution might be for a particular problem. It is based on characteristics of a wide range of P2P systems from the literature, both proposed and deployed. These include budget, resource relevance, trust, rate of system change, and criticality.</p>
