                        <p class="Para">East Adriatic coast is characterized by a large number of islands that have always presented a challenging task in implementation of efficient health care in this part of Croatia. One of the most difficult problems is absence of medical specialists because specialist practices on islands are not financially self-sustainable. In particular, successful implementation of health care on the North-Adriatic islands of Cres, Mali Losinj, and neighboring islands has shown to difficult, especially during the high tourist season when the island population becomes much larger then during the out-of-season period. In this paper, we present a web-based system for medical teleconsultation support on islands and other rural areas. The system provides general practitioners on islands with tools to communicate patient information to specialists, typically located in large mainland medical centers. The system supports transport of multimedia medical information. Specialists use the system to transmit medical consultation back to the referring physician. Special attention is paid to security aspects.</p>
