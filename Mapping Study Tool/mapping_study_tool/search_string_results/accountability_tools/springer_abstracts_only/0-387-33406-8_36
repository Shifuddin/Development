                          <p class="Para">The concept of security culture is relatively new. It is often investigated in a simplistic manner focusing on end-users and on the technical aspects of security. Security, however, is a management problem and as a result the investigation of security culture should also have a management focus. This paper discusses security culture based on an organisational culture framework of eight dimensions. We believe that use of this framework in security culture research will reduce the inherent biases of researchers who tend to focus on only technical aspects of culture from an end users perspective.</p>
