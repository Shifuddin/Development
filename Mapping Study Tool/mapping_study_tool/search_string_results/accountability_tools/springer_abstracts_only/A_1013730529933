                          <p class="Para">Over the next two to four years the UK Government will be under increasing pressure to deliver on the promises made to improve public services and modernise the way in which these services are designed, built and delivered. The UK is not alone in having to improve and modernise mdash the challenges being faced, especially in health, education, crime and transport are global issues and they are issues that cannot be solved through increased spending alone. What is required is 'radical innovation'; new or novel applications of technology through new or novel organisational models. This paper examines the 'hard' side of radical innovation, looking at the disruptive elements of communication engineering and the challenges faced by public sector organisations worldwide, while remembering that technologies alone do nothing without changing the very nature of how people organise and use them. The concepts of 'embedded governance' and 'individual agility' are introduced to exemplify radical innovation.</p>
