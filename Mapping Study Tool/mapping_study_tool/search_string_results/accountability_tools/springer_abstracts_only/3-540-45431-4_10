                          <p class="Para">In this paper we define an information modeling procedure for the application of the modeling constructs from the Natural Language Modeling (NLM) methodology. The information modeling procedure that is presented in this paper contains a number of semantic bridges that specify when a specific user-input is required and what transformations must be applied in order to create an information model for a specific Universe of Discourse.</p>
