                          <p class="Para">We describe a model for the data storage, retrieval and manipulation requirements of complex system applications based on pervasive, integrated, application specific databases shared over a peer to peer network. Such a model can significannotly increase productivity through transparent data sharing and querying as well as aid collaborations. We show a proof of concept of this approach as implemented in the Adun molecular simulation application together with a discussion of its limitations and possible extensions.</p>
