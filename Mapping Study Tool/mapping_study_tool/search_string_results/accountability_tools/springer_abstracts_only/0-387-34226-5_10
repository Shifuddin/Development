                          <p class="Para">This paper addresses the development of mechanisms for the creation of OSSD exchanges that could be used by developers across any geographical range, as long as all the developers can interact via some open network infrastructure such as the Internet. The structure of these exchanges can range from public repositories such as Sourceforge.net to intra-organizational forums for software development within an enterprise. We examine in particular the structure of an exchange model based on protocols for a robust online marketplace.</p>
