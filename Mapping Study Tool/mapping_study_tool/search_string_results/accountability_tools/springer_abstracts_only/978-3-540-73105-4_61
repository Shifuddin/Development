                          <p class="Para">Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) have become commonplace addition to the normal environments surrounding us. Based on IEEE 802.11 technology, WLANs can now be found in the working place, at homes, and in many cities’ central district area as open or commercial services. These access points in the public areas are called “hotspots”. They provide Internet access in various types of public places such as shopping districts, cafés, airports, and shops. As the hotspots are being used by a growing user base that is also quite heterogeneous, their usability is becoming evermore important. As hotspots can be accessed by a number of devices differing in their capabilities, size, and user interfaces, achieving good usability in accessing the services is not straightforward. This paper reports a user study and usability analysis on WLAN access to discover user’s needs and suggest enhancements to fight the usability problems in WLAN access.</p>
