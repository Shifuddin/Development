                          <p class="Para">Highly cited articles are interesting because of the potential association between high citation counts and high quality research. This study investigates the 82 most highly cited Information Science and Library Science’ (IS&amp;LS) articles (the top 0.1%) in the Web of Science from the perspectives of disciplinarity, annual citation patterns, and first author citation profiles. First, the relative frequency of these 82 articles was much lower for articles solely in IS&amp;LS than for those in IS&amp;LS and at least one other subject, suggesting that that the promotion of interdisciplinary research in IS&amp;LS may be conducive to improving research quality. Second, two thirds of the first authors had an h-index in IS&amp;LS of less than eight, show that much significant research is produced by researchers without a high overall IS&amp;LS research productivity. Third, there is a moderate correlation (0.46) between citation ranking and the number of years between peak year and year of publication. This indicates that high quality ideas and methods in IS&amp;LS often are deployed many years after being published.</p>
