                          <p class="Para">One of the key challenges in public safety networks is to ensure a high level of information quality (IQ) during disaster response. Since many evaluation reports on disaster response efforts have revealed instances of poor IQ, both academics and practitioners are in search of information architectures that assure IQ. This article focuses on the hurdles and opportunities for IQ assurance via information architectures. Drawing on two opposing coordination approaches, hierarchical versus netcentric, we suggest adopting a hybrid, information orchestration-based approach for assuring IQ. While hierarchical coordination approaches result in architectures dictating predefined information flows dependent on structures and procedures, netcentric information coordination emphasizes the need for individual self-synchronization driven by events. Even though both architectures have their strengths and weaknesses depending on several contingencies, both include characteristics that hamper IQ assurance for relief workers. Information orchestration offers the middle ground between hierarchical and netcentric approaches and defined as a heterarchical form of information coordination consisting of a specific set of roles and capabilities related to the collection, enrichment, and dissemination of high-quality information. Capabilities that need to be developed according to the information orchestration approach constitute a research agenda.</p>
