                        <p class="Para">Privacy is a complex issue which cannot be handled by exclusively technical means. The work described in this paper results from a multidisciplinary project involving lawyers and computer scientists with the double goal to (1) reconsider the fundamental values motivating privacy protection and (2) study the conditions for a better protection of these values by a combination of legal and technical means. One of these conditions is to provide to the individuals effective ways to convey their consent to the disclosure of their personal data. This paper focuses on the formal framework proposed in the project to deliver this consent through software agents.</p>
