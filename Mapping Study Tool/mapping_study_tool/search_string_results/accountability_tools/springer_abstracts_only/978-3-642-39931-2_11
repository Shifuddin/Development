                          <p class="Para">Legitimate expectation in the context of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">culpa in contrahendo</em> is an important legal concept for the study of good faith and the duty to negotiate with good care. However when wanting to model it and reason about it, one finds that most existing legal formalisations do not directly account for the concept. In this paper we present a formal model that can explicitly model and reason about legitimate expectations by extending the formal <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">InstAL</span> legal framework. We demonstrate our extensions with the help of a private law case study which has gained wide popularity in Japanese law.</p>
