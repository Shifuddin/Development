                          <p class="Para">Internet-based distribution of mass-market content provides great opportunities for producers, distributors, and consumers, but it may seriously threaten users’ privacy. Some of the paths to loss of privacy are quite familiar (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e.g.</em>, mining of credit-card data), but some are new or much more serious than they were in earlier distribution regimes. We examine the contributions that digital-rights-management (DRM) technology can make to both compromising and protecting users’ privacy. We argue that the privacy-enhancing technology (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e.g.</em>, encryption, anonymity, and pseudonymity) that absorbs most of the attention of the security R&amp;D community cannot by itself solve the privacy problems raised by DRM, although it can play a role in various solutions. Finally, we provide a list of “privacy engineering” principles for DRM systems, some of which are easy to implement and potentially quite effective.</p>
