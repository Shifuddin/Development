                          <p class="Para">This research offers a constitutive, mixed-method approach in order to identify trust-influencing and -influenced factors in cloud computing, which should lead to a fundamental understanding of the formation and retention of trust in cloud computing. In cloud computing, sensitive data and whole processes are transferred and outsourced to the cloud provider, without necessitating face-to-face communication with a sales assistant. We find the research methods literature review, laboratory experimental research, semi-structured expert interviews, surveys, vignettes, and (retrospective) think aloud complemented by neuroscientific methods to be suitable to reach the target set. Since vignettes, think aloud and neuroscientific methods are underrepresented or rather new to the information systems domain, in this contribution we pay special attention on these. Our mixed-method approach has the ability to verify, reaffirm, and refine theories affected by cloud computing or even to create new ones. Based on the findings of this research, recommendations for actions as well as implications for users and providers alike can be deduced. Since we rely on triangulation of the data set, the limitations of the whole approach reflect the limitations of each applied research method. Preliminary results indicate that 76% of cloud users focus primarily on data security, whereas 58% name the price of a certain cloud computing service to be relevant to provider selection.</p>
