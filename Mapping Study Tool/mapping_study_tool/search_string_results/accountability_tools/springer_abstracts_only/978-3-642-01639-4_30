                        <p class="Para">This paper presents the approach of the distributed RBAC (DRBAC) access control of the multi-application delegated to the multi-user and multi-relying party federations. In our approach, DRBAC utilizes Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI) to serve the authentication and authorization. We propose the dynamic mapping scheme based on the Attribute Certification model in handling user identification, role assignment, and privilege delegation. To encourage distributedness, better scalability and performance, as well as ease of management and extension, Multi-Agent Systems concept is applied for the automation of the authentication, authorization and accountability functionalities. For the trust management of multiple PKI domains, we employ the Certificate Trust Lists (CTLs) model to make the different PKI domains can interoperate effectively. Finally, our ongoing implementation is demonstrated to prove our proposed model.</p>
