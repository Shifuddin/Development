                          <p class="Para">Existing web services and mashups exemplify the need for flexible construction of distributed applications. How to do so securely remains a topic of current research. We present <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Tapido</span>, a programming model to address Trust and Authorization concerns via Provenance and Integrity in systems of Distributed Objects. Creation of <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Tapido</span> objects requires (static) authorization checks and their communication provides fine-grain control of their embedded authorization effects. <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Tapido</span> programs constrain such delegation of rights by using provenance information. A type-and-effect system with effect polymorphism provides static support for the programmer to reason about security policies. We illustrate the programming model and static analysis with example programs and policies.</p>
