                          <p class="Para">To address todayâ€™s major concerns of health service providers regarding security, resilience and data protection when moving on the cloud, we propose an approach to build a trustworthy healthcare platform cloud, based on a trustworthy cloud infrastructure. This paper first highlights the main security and privacy risks of market available commodity clouds, and outlines security and privacy requirements of a trustworthy health platform cloud, on top of which to deploy various health applications, in compliance with EU data protection legislation. Results from the recent EU TClouds project will be described as a possible solution towards trustworthy cloud architecture, based on a federated cloud-of-clouds, while enforcing security, resilience and data protection in various cloud layers for provisioning trustworthy IaaS, PaaS and SaaS healthcare services.</p>
