                          <p class="Para">Current anonymous e-mail systems offer unconditional anonymity to their users which can provoke abusive behaviour. Dissatisfied users will drop out and liability issues may even force the system to suspend or cease its services. Therefore, controlling abuse is as important as protecting the anonymity of legitimate users when designing anonymous applications.</p>
                          <p class="Para">This paper describes the design and implementation AAEM, an accountable anonymous e-mail system. An existing anonymous e-mail system is enhanced with a control mechanism that allows for accountability. The system creates a trusted environment for senders, recipients and system operators. It provides a reasonable trade-off between anonymity, accountability, usability and flexibility.</p>
