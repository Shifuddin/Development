                            <p class="Para">Behavior patterns of users in mobile social cloud are always based on real world relationships and can be used to infer a level of trust between users. In this paper, we describe the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">implicit call behavioral graph</em> which is formed by users’ interactions with call. We rate these relationships to form a dynamic local cloud trust, which enables users to evaluate the trust values between users within the context of a mobile social cloud network. We, then, calculate local trust values according to users’ behavioral attributes, such as call frequency, relevance, call moment, and satisfaction. Due to the unique nature of the social cloud, we discuss the propagation and aggregation of local trust values for global social cloud network. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our trust model through simulations, and show simulation results that demonstrate the importance of interaction-based behavioural relationships in recommendation system.</p>
