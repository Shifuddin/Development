                          <p class="Para">This paper begins with an introduction to DAVIC, with particular reference to its objectives and plans. It then considers the split of the functional model into the three roles â€” service consumer system, delivery system and service provider system. Once the vertical split of the functional model has been considered the horizontal split into S1-S4 levels is covered. The paper then expands on the concepts of session and connection control through the use of the S2, S3 and S4 levels in the set-up, transfer and release of a user-to-network session and the end-to-end control of the user-to-user session. Finally, future plans/directions for DAVIC are considered, along with the adoption of Internet technologies within the DAVIC specifications.</p>
