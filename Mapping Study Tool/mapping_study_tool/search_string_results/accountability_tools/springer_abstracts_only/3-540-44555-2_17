                          <p class="Para">The ECOOP workshop on Mobile Object Systems was first organized in 1995 and has been held every year since. The first two episodes in the series - entitled “Objects and Agents” (1995) and “Agents on the Move” (1996) - were exploratory in nature, reflecting a growing awareness and interest in the possibilities of mobile code and mobile objects for Internet programming. Towards the end of the 1990s, Interest in the domain began to stabilize and several mobile object systems appeared in the research community. As a consequence, further editions of the Mobile Object Systems workshop concentrated on specific aspects of mobile objects. Thus, the title of the 1997 workshop was “Operating System Support”, the theme of the 1998 workshop was “Security”, and the theme of the 1999 installment was “Programming Language Support”.</p>
