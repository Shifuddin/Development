                          <p class="Para">In ciphertext-policy attributed-based encryption (CP-ABE), each ciphertext is labeled by the encryptor with an access structure (also called ciphertext policy) and each private key is associated with a set of attributes. A user should be able to decrypt a ciphertext if and only if his private key attributes satisfy the access structure.</p>
                          <p class="Para">The traditional security property of CP-ABE is plaintext privacy, which ciphertexts reveal no information about the underlying plaintext. At ACNSâ€™08, Nishide, Yoneyama and Ohta introduced the notion of ciphertext-policy hiding CP-ABE. In addition to protecting the privacy of plaintexts, ciphertext-policy hiding CP-ABE also protects the description of the access structures associated with ciphertexts. They observed that ciphertext-policy hiding CP-ABE can be constructed from attribute-hiding inner-product predicate encryption (PE), and presented two constructions of ciphertext-policy hiding CP-ABE supporting restricted access structures, which can be expressed as <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">AND</span> gates on multi-valued attributes with wildcards. However, their schemes were only proven <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">selectively</em> secure.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we first describe the construction of ciphertext-policy hiding CP-ABE from attribute-hiding inner-product PE <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">formally</em>. Then, we propose a concrete construction of ciphertext-policy hiding CP-ABE supporting the same access structure as that of Nishide, Yoneyama and Ohta, but our scheme is proven <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">fully</em> secure.</p>
