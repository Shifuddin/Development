                          <p class="Para">This paper provides first ideas and considerations for designing and developing future technologies relevant for challenging privacy-preserving preventive applications of contact-less sensors. We introduce four use-cases: preventive detailed acquisition of fingerprints, coarse scans for fingerprint localisation, separation of overlapping fingerprints and age determination for manipulation detection and automatic securing of evidence. To enable and support these four use-cases in future, we suggest developing four techniques: coarse scans, detailed scans, separation and age determination of fingerprints. We derive a new definition for the separation from a forensic approach: presence detection of overlapping fingerprints, estimation of the number of fingerprints, separation and sequence (order) detection. We discuss main challenges for technical solutions enabling the suggested privacy-preserving use-cases combined with a brief summary of preliminary results from our first experiments. We analyse the legal principles and requirements for European law and the design of the use-cases, which show tendencies for other countries.</p>
