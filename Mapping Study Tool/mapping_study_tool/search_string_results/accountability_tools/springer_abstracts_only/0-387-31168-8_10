                          <p class="Para">Case studies from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and USA are used to illustrate the impact of the “war on terrorism” on cybercitizens. The authors use relevant Articles of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> as a benchmark against which to assess new and changed legislation in democratic societies. It is proposed that “Principles of Cyber Liberty” be articulated within the framework of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> by providing adjuncts to the relevant Articles to clarify the application of these liberties and rights in cyberspace, and the potential conflicts between these rights and the new “war on terrorism” initiatives.</p>
