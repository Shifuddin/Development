                          <p class="Para">Outcome-based education (OBE) is being implemented in many institutions despite controversies and debates about issues concerning whether learning outcomes could be clearly defined. The concept of learning outcomes has been used in a lot of education research work. However the measurement of learning outcomes is usually done in a simple way using one metric. Report of experience about deployment of OBE in real-life situation using different learning outcomes in different curricula has not been commonly seen. In this paper, Achieved Learning Outcome Indicator (ALOI) was proposed to refine the modeling of assessment quantification in terms of hierarchical learning outcomes and many-to-many mapping between learning outcomes and assessment activities. A Web-based Learning Outcome Tracking System was designed to implement the ALOI. The system could also provide of analysis to give different levels of visualization of learning outcomes achievement of students. The system had been tested with course data collected over a period of three years. Experience of implementation in City University of Hong Kong and lessons learned were reported in this paper.</p>
