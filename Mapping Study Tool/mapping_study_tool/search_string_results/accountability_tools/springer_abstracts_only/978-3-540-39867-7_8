                        <p class="Para">This paper describes TAPI, an offline scheme intended for general Internet-based micropayments. TAPI, which extends and combines concepts from the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">KeyNote Microchecks</em> and OTPCoins architectures, encodes risk management rules in bank-issued usersâ€™ credentials which are in turn used to acquire small-valued payment tokens. The scheme has very low transaction overhead and can be tuned to use different risk strategies for different environments and clients.</p>
