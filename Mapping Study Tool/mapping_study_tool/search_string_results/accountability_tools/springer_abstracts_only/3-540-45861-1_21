                        <p class="Para">Accountability in electronic commerce (e-commerce) protocols is concerned with the ability to show that particular parties who engage in the protocols are responsible for some transactions. Traditionally, it is used only for resolving disputes amongst parties. Many logics were proposed for reasoning about the accountability. However, these logics lack of the application to real-world e-commerce protocols. In this paper, we show that these logics are inadequate to analyze the accountability property of such real-world protocols. We then propose a modification of the existing logics to deal with such real-world protocols. Furthermore, we propose a novel use of the accountability for specifying and analyzing the goals of e-commerce protocols, in particular client privacy property.</p>
