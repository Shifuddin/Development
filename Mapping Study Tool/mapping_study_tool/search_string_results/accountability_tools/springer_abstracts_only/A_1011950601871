                          <p class="Para">Biometric methods offer an alternative approach to authentication of individuals, using distinctive physical features of the body (such as fingerprints) or characteristic actions of people (e.g. digitised forms of written signatures). Although systems have been available for over thirty years, there is now a sound understanding of how they can be used to best effect, based upon continued research studies, experience gained in trials and deployments, and the development of cheaper and smaller devices. The activities of standardisation bodies point to the increasing maturity of these technologies. However, widespread use of biometric methods will depend upon other factors, e.g. strong business cases that justify whole life costs against the total costs of ownership of existing authentication methods, and the acceptance of such methods by consumers, citizens and employees.</p>
