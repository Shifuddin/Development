                          <p class="Para">As data integration proliferates, private information can be spread across the system extensively. Striving for protection of possessed sensitive information, enterprises thus need comprehensive means to control such propagation. As shown in the paper, approaches to date do not address this need sufficiently. We, therefore, propose a private data propagation control framework (Providence), which aims to give a comprehensive view on private data usage throughout the system and to facilitate privacy-related decision making.</p>
