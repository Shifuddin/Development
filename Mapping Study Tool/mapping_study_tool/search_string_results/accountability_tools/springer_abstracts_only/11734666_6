                          <p class="Para">Logging is a central service in computing systems. It lays the foundation for accountability and audit services in computing systems, as well as for other accessory services. While providing logging services in traditional computing systems is a relatively smooth process, it turns to an intricate task in pervasive computing systems. In this context, we present two contributions addressing this problem. First, we develop an approach to securely log information in marginally trusted collectors. Second, we investigate the question of how to securely delegate our logging protocol to a relay equipped with trusted-computing modules.</p>
