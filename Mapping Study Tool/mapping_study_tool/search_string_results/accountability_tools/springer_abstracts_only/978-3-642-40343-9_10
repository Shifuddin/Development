                          <p class="Para">Hospital information systems increasingly handle information related to the health status of citizens, due to the proliferation of the use of the electronic health record. Because of this, hospital information systems constitute a part of a countryâ€™s critical information infrastructure; hence, the state of affairs regarding their security is of paramount interest. In this paper we report on the results of a survey performed among all public Greek hospitals regarding the security of their information systems. Comparisons to the situation in other countries as this is manifested in similar studies are made and conclusions are drawn; these indicate that there is much room for improvement.</p>
