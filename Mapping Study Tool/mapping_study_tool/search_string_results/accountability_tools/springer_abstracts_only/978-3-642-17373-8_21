                          <p class="Para">We design cryptographic protocols that recognize best case (optimistic) situations and exploit them. As a case study, we present a new concurrent zero-knowledge protocol that is expected to require only a small constant number of rounds in practice. To prove that our protocol is secure, we identify a weak property of concurrent schedules—called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">footer-freeness</em>—that suffices for efficient simulation.</p>
