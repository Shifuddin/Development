                          <p class="Para">The paper offers a solution to the problem of specifying computational systems that behave in accordance with a given set of ethical principles. The proposed solution is based on the concepts of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ethical requirements</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ethical protocols</em>. A new conceptual tool, called the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Control Closure</em> of an operation, is defined and used to translate ethical principles into ethical requirements and protocols. The concept of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Generalised Informational Privacy</em> (GIP) is used as a paradigmatic example of an ethical principle. GIP is defined in such a way as to (i) discriminate specific cases in which an individual’s GIP can be infringed without accessing the individual’s data; (ii) separate unauthorised accesses to data that do not respect the right to GIP from access that do; and (iii) distinguish different degrees of GIP. Finally a camera phone is used to illustrate the proposed solution.</p>
