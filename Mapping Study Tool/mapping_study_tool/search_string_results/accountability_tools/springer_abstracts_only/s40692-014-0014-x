                          <p class="Para">The objective of this study was to explore how teachers’ professional attributes affect their attitudes towards assimilating a computerized system for managing learning and teaching in school. Sixty teachers from an experimental high school assimilating computerized system for managing learning and teaching were sampled and participated in this study. The research tools included in-depth interviews with a sample of 10 teachers and a questionnaire on attitudes towards change. The interviews indicate a hierarchy in the behavioral attributes towards change, from resistance associated with knowledge and skills towards resistance based on professional aspects and professional values and identity. An AMOS analysis finds that a high level of computer literacy predicts low resistance to change, while considerable seniority and a key position in school predict a high level of resistance to change. The study hones our understanding of the unique impact of the teacher’s readiness to assimilate changes in school.</p>
