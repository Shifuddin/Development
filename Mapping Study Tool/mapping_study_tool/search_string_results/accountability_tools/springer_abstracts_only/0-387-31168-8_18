                          <p class="Para">This paper takes a broad perspective on ambient, intelligent technologies in the context of contemporary European society at the turn of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The underlying ideas and expectations of ambient intelligence in a period when Europe focuses progressively on the various social, economic, and ethical challenges facing the Information Society are discussed. The use of information and communication technologies in different organizational and economic settings are explored, with an illustrative focus on eHealth. It is particularly argued that more space, effort and facilities need to be created for a public social and ethical debate among Europeanâ€™s citizens with regard to information and communication technologies development.</p>
