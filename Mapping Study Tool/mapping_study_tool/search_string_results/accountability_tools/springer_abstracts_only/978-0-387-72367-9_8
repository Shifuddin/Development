                          <p class="Para">The Common Criteria (CC) for Information Technology Security Evaluation provides comprehensive guidelines for the evaluation and certification of IT security regarding data security and data privacy. Due to the very complex and time-consuming certification process a lot of companies abstain from a CC certification. We created the CC Ontology tool, which is based on an ontological representation of the CC catalog, to support the evaluator at the certification process. Tasks such as the planning of an evaluation process, the review of relevant documents or the creating of reports are supported by the CC Ontology tool. With the development of this tool we reduce the time and costs needed to complete a certification.</p>
