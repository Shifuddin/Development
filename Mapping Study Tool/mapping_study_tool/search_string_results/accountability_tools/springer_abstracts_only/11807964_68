                          <p class="Para">Due to the stateless nature of the internet, it is an intricate problem to determine the source of spoofed attacking packets. To handle this problem we utilize the IP traceback mechanism to know the actual source of an IP datagram. While many IP traceback techniques have been proposed but most of the previous studies focus and offer solutions for DDoS attacks done on IPv4 environment. Significant difference exists between IPv4 and IPv6 Networks. Therefore, the mechanisms for tracing the origin of attacks in IPv6 networks have abundant differences from those of IPv4 networks. In this paper, we proposed an efficient Lightweight IPv6 traceback algorithm. We also discussed the problems related to previously proposed IPv4 traceback schemes and presented the Error Correction and Modified Path MTU calculation algorithm to make our scheme more practical.</p>
