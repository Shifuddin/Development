                        <p class="Para">We describe a new approach and system platform for enabling multilateral security in distributed applications. The major goal is to support users configuring their end systems and to negotiate among security requirements of different users with heterogeneous roles. Typical security features such as confidentiality or integrity of transmitted data are presented to the user at different levels of abstraction based on an inheritance hierarchy, according to his background knowledge and experiences. The system platform is implemented in Java, with distributed interaction based on Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). It enables flexible integration of existing security libraries and facilities. As a validation example, we present a teleshopping scenario that has been realized using the support platform.</p>
