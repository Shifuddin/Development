                          <p class="Para">Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) are applications that collect data from a system in order to automate the monitoring and controlling of its activities. Several industrial fields such as, electric utilities, water supplies and buildingsâ€™ facilities have already adopted SCADA systems to increase the efficiency and reduce cost. However, the IT community is concerned about the level of security that any applied SCADA system provides. This paper concentrates on the major security threats encountered in SCADA systems. In addition, it discusses a new proposed methodology in order to increase the system security with minimal impact on efficiency. The proposed scheme provides several security services which are mutual authentication, confidentiality, data integrity and accountability.</p>
