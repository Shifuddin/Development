                            <p class="Para">This paper inquires into the possibility of the development of ICT at the Bottom of the Pyramid. Its focus is on philosophically founded methods and languages applicable on a universal and exemplary basis. The methods are taken to be based on abduction and sweeping-in-processes and the languages are taken to be based on categorical imperatives of Kant and the discourse ethics of Habermas/Apel. These ‘taken to be’s’ are contrasted with Jacques Derrida’s ‘Deconstruction’. Paul Feyerabend’s ‘Against Method’ as well as complexity theory. The explicated monological/dialogical and formal / procedural methods and languages together with its counterparts are used to start a sweeping-in-process on ‘Social Informatics’.</p>
