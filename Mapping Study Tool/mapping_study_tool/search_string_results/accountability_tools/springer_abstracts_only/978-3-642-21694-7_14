                        <p class="Para">This paper presents first an ontology of risk for interdependent and heterogeneous Critical Infrastructures (CIs). It defines a data structure called Service Quality Descriptor (SQD) specifying the degradation of QoS over time, which should be shared between interconnected CI. SQD are shared in real time and contain a precise prediction of the future quality of service, so that this sharing can be useful to avoid failures, identify interdependencies, or accelerate and coordinate power failure recoveries and service restoration. Finally, the paper proposes a simplified method to determine the SQD of a delivery service as a linear function of the SQD of supporting services and parameters depending on the service delivery infrastructure. The approach has been defined within the European FP-7 project MICIE, in line with the EU initiative to establish a Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CIWIN).</p>
