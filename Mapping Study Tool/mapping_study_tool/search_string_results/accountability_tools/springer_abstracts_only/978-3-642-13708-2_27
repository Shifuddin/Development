                          <p class="Para">We introduce WORM-ORAM, a first mechanism that combines Oblivious RAM (ORAM) access privacy and data confidentiality with Write Once Read Many (WORM) regulatory data retention guarantees. Clients can outsource their database to a server with full confidentiality and data access privacy, and, for data retention, the server ensures client access WORM semantics. In general <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">simple confidentiality</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">WORM</em> assurances are easily achievable e.g., via an encrypted outsourced data repository with server-enforced read-only access to existing records (albeit encrypted). However, this becomes hard when also <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">access privacy</em> is to be ensured â€“ when client access patterns are necessarily hidden and the server cannot enforce access control directly. WORM-ORAM overcomes this by deploying a set of zero-knowledge proofs to convince the server that all stages of the protocol are WORM-compliant.</p>
