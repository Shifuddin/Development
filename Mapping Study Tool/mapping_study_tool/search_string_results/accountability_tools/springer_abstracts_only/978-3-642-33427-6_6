                            <p class="Para">The lack of capacity, unplanned outages of sub-contractors, a disaster recovery plan, acquisitions, or other financial goals may force cloud providers to enter into collaborations with other cloud providers. However, the cloud provider is not always fully aware of the security level of a potential collaborative cloud provider. This can lead to security breaches and customersâ€™ data leakage, ending in court cases and financial penalties. In our paper, we analyze different types of cloud collaborations with respect to their security concerns and discuss possible solutions. We also outline trusted security entities as a feasible approach for managing security governance risks and propose our security broker solution for ad hoc cloud collaborations. Our work provides support in the cloud provider selection process and can be used by cloud providers as a foundation for their initial risk assessment.</p>
