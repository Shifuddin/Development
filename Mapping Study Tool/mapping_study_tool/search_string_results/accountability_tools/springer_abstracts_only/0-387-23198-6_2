                          <p class="Para">Service Level Agreement (SLA) is used as the comer stone for building service quality management (SQM) systems. SLA and the processes associated with them, establish a two-way accountability for service, which is negotiated and mutually agreed upon, by customer and service provider. It defines a set of service level indicators and their corresponding Service Level Objectives (SLO), which defines a threshold for the indicator value. Service quality assessment can be accomplished in two modes, on-line and offline. Off-line service level evaluation is performed only at the end of the period of service delivery, whereas on-line service evaluation supports continuous supervision of service quality. This paper presents a method for on-line control of SLA that evaluates indicator value each time an event that changes its value occurs. The method also computes the deadline to reach the corresponding SLO, what is important for pro-active control.</p>
