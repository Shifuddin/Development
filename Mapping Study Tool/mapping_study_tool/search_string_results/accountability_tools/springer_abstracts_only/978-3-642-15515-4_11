                          <p class="Para">Ubiquitous access to patient medical records is an important aspect of caring for patient safety. Unavailability of sufficient medical information at the patient point-of-care could possibly lead to a fatality. In this paper we propose employing emergent technologies such as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Java SIM Cards</em> (JSC), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Smart Phones</em> (SP), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Next Generation Networks</em> (NGN), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Near Field Communications</em> (NFC), <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Public Key Infrastructure</em> (PKI), and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Biometric Identification</em> to develop a secure framework and related protocols for ubiquitous access to <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Electronic Health Records</em> (EHRs). A partial EHR contained within a JSC can be used at the patient point-of-care in order to help quick diagnosis of a patientâ€™s problems. The full EHR can be accessed from an Electronic Healthcare Records Centre (EHRC).</p>
