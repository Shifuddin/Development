                          <p class="Para">This paper gives an overview of issues in privacy protection of personal information in the cloud, and describes a variety of approaches that may be used to address these issues. Some of these approaches are available for use now; others are relatively immature, but look promising. The most appropriate approach varies according to the type of data to be processed or application to be run in the cloud.</p>
