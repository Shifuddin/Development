                          <p class="Para">Technologies such as Web Services and grid computing are making it technically possible for companies to co-operate more closely, coupling their automated business processes and sharing resources dynamically and flexibly. They should make practical new business models in which small specialist companies with complementary capabilities combine flexibly to provide a range of services currently only within the scope of large corporations. A coalition of enterprises co-operating in this way is termed a virtual organisation (VO). Achieving the benefits of co-operation while retaining agility, autonomy and security remains a significant challenge.</p>
                          <p class="Para">This challenge is being addressed by TrustCoM, a research collaboration involving Atos Origin sa, BAE Systems, BT, CCLRC, ETH, HLRS, IBM, Imperial College London, King’s College London, European Microsoft Innovation Centre, NRCCL, SAP, SICS, SINTEF, the University of Milan, and the University of Kent. TrustCoM will provide a conceptual and architectural framework for secure and flexible co-operation plus methods and tools for implementing it in a variety of business contexts. Two practical test-beds are being constructed as part of the project — one set in the aerospace industry, and the other concerning provision of tailored composite eLearning services by a consortium of training service providers.</p>
                          <p class="Para">An important concept to emerge from TrustCoM is the VO virtual hosting environment or shell. This is an implementation of the kernel of the TrustCoM framework operated by a hosting service provider as the nucleus around which a community of enterprises may form. A community hosted by the environment — typically operating in a particular industry or application domain — must be bound by agreements, conventions and procedures that facilitate co-operation. The joining process involves federating the new SME’s platforms with the core platform, agreeing to contracts, registering services, and so on. The environment incorporates facilities to support VO formation and secure operation, including trust-enhancing and policy enforcement mechanisms.</p>
                          <p class="Para">This paper describes the main concepts and features of the TrustCoM framework as used in a virtual hosting environment.</p>
