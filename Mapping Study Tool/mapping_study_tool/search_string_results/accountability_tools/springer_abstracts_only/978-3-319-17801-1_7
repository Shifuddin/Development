                      <p class="Para">Geospatial Semantic Web has the potential to improve the intelligence, flexibility, and usability of geospatial applications. In this chapter, we reviewed several applications of geospatial semantic web that we developed recently, which include a natural language interface for geospatial data query, a volunteered geospatial information system, a geospatial interface for transit network, and a spatial decision support system. The protocols, workflows, and algorithms used in the prototypes are covered in previous chapters, so this chapter focuses on the software libraries and the programming aspects of the implementations. The applications demonstrate the effectiveness of Geospatial Semantic Web in integrating data with heterogeneous semantics. Ontology constructs such as classes and properties can be used to map the definitions of the existing data sets to the domain and application ontologies in order to bridge the semantic gap between data sets.</p>
