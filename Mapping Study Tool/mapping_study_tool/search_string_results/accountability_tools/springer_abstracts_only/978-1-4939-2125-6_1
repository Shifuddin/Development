                          <p class="Para">In complex situations, it can be difficult to calculate the probability of an event, especially if there are many dependencies. A graphical model, a graph whose nodes represent the variables and whose edges represent dependencies between them, provides a guide for both constructing and computing with the statistical models. Discrete Bayesian networks, graphical models in which all the variables are discrete and all the edges are directed, have particular computational advantages. Bayesian networks have the capacity to represent complex and changing states of information in a Bayesian fashion. This book explores the implications of applying Bayesian networks to educational assessment. This approach supports complex models as needed in for diagnostic testing and constructed response or interactive tasks, but it is also compatible with the models and techniques that have developed in psychometrics over the past century.</p>
