                          <p class="Para">This position paper outlines a number of challenges currently faced by the aerospace community in addressing system, software, and hardware safety. These challenges include increasing complexity, lagging regulatory guidance, a divergent set of design assurance guidelines, and ever advancing technology. To address these challenges, four recommendations are offered: consolidation of design assurance, increased resiliency in product design, a move to less prescriptive standards in favor of a goal-based approach, and the imposition of personnel qualification.</p>
