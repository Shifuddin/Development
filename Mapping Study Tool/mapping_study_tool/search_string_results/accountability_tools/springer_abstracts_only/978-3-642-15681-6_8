                          <p class="Para">While the technological basis for cloud services is relatively mature, the development of the market is still at an early stage. There is considerable potential, but also a number of widely held concerns which are inhibiting mainstream adoption of cloud services by business. This paper is based on the outcome of the ETSI TC CLOUD Workshop, “Grids, Clouds and Service Infrastructures”, an event which brought together key stakeholders of the grid, cloud and telecommunication domains to review the state of the art and current trends. The focus was on areas where standardization has the potential to encourage development of the market, with a particular focus on cloud computing and services. This paper introduces and expands on the conclusions reached. It is intended to serve as the basis for future work.</p>
