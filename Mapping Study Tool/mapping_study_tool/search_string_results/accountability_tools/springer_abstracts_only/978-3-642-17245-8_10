                          <p class="Para">Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are an approach to structuring software in which distributed applications are constructed as collections of interacting services. While they promise many benefits including significant cost savings through service reuse and faster application design and implementation, many of the very aspects that make SOAs attractive amplify the dependability challenges faced by distributed applications. This <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">dependability dilemma</em> becomes especially pronounced when the services making up an application are owned and managed by different organizations or are executed on resources owned and operated by third parties, such as cloud computing or utility computing providers. This paper reviews the vision of SOAs, and discusses the characteristics that make them particularly challenging for dependability. It then discusses techniques that have been proposed for building dependable SOAs and why a comprehensive solution remains elusive despite these efforts. Finally, we argue that—despite the fact that service independence is often cited as one of the main attractions of SOAs—any successful solution requires collaborative quality of service (QoS) in which services, service providers, and resource providers cooperate to implement dependability. The primary goals of this paper are to highlight the dependability implications of architectures based on decoupled and independent services such as SOAs, and to suggest possible approaches to enhancing dependability by weakening these characteristics in a controlled way.</p>
