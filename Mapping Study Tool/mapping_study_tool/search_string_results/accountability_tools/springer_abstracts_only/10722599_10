                          <p class="Para">The first phase of the SET protocol, namely Cardholder Registration, has been modelled inductively. This phase is presented in outline and its formal model is described. A number of basic lemmas have been proved about the protocol using Isabelle/HOL, along with a theorem stating that a certification authority will certify a given key at most once. Many ambiguities, contradictions and omissions were noted while formalizing the protocol.</p>
