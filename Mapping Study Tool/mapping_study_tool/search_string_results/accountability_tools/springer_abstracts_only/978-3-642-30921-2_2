                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we discuss a protocol allowing the remote user of a system providing revocable anonymity to be assured of whether or not her anonymity is revoked. We achieve this via a novel use of Trusted Computing and Virtual Monotonic Counters. The protocol has wide-ranging scope in a variety of computer security fields, such as electronic cash, fair exchange and electronic voting.</p>
