                          <p class="Para">This article focuses on the Commonwealth and other mainly Anglophone countries in East and Central Africa. This is an area that has tended to be neglected in recent discourse and debate. The relationship between accountability and record keeping systems is a major theme. Other challenges that have emerged over the last half century are analysed and commented on. An attempt is made to place developments in a wider political and economic context. In addition, the question is posed whether transformation discourses generated in post-Apartheid South Africa ‘fit’ with the experiences of countries north of the Limpopo. A great many setbacks and obstacles to success are described. The focus, however, is on identifying paths to progress rather than surrendering to cynicism.</p>
