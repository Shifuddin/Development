                          <p class="Para">Public transparency is made evident by the dissemination of the acts practiced by the Public Administration, aiming at social control and at citizens’ participation. As provided in Art. 37 of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, “Public Administration must follow the principles of lawfulness, impersonality, morality, publicity and efficiency” [5]. Faced with such principles, our aim is to verify the perception of municipal managers, software developers and citizens concerning the transparency and the control of public accounts via the Citizen’s Portal of the State of Mato Grosso (Brazil), comparing data in a triangular way. For this, a comprehensive review of the literature in the area is made, as well as the collection and qualitative analysis of data with the use of the triangulation method, which allowed comparison of the opinions of the subjects involved in the research.</p>
