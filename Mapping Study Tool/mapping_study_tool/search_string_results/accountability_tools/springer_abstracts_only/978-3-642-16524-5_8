                          <p class="Para">We present an ontology-based model of a simple economic crime, namely fraudulent disbursement. The extension of a previously proposed ontology model, called the “minimal model”, is used to capture the mechanism of the example case. The conceptual minimal model consists of eight layers of concepts, structured in order to use available data on facts to uncover relations. Using these concepts and appropriate relations and rules, we are able to map crime activity options (roles of particular type of managers). This makes it possible to phrase these roles in the language of penal code sanctions. Finally, the roles of persons in the crime are mapped into a set of sanctions. Prospects on future reasoning capabilities of the tool are presented.</p>
