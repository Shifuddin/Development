                          <p class="Para">Today, many organizations generate large amount of data and have many users that need only partial access to resources at any time to collaborate in making critical decisions. Thus, there is a need for a scalable access control model that simplifies the management of security policies and handles the heterogeneity inherent in the information system. This paper proposes an ontology-based distributed solution to this problem, with the benefits of being scalable and producing acceptable response times.</p>
