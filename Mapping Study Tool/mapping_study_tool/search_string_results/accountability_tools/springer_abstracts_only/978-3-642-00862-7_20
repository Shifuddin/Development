                          <p class="Para">We present the first dynamic universal accumulator that allows (1) the accumulation of elements in a DDH-hard group <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1">\(\mathbb{G}\)</span> and (2) one who knows <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">x</em> such that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">y</em> = <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">g</em>
                          <p class="Para">We introduce the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Attribute-Based Anonymous Credential System</em>, which allows the verifier to authenticate anonymous users according to any access control policy expressible as a formula of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">possibly negated</em> boolean user attributes. We construct the system from our accumulator.</p>
