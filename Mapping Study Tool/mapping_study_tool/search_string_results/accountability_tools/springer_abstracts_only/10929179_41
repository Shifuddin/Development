                          <p class="Para">This paper is concerned with e-government implementation at the local level. It proposes that effective realization of the radical change promised by e-government depends upon a sense of crisis, a problematisation, which motivates the organisation to respond with urgency and vigour. The paper reports a study of one leading local authority based upon interviews of its senior managers. It finds no sense of crisis, and instead obfuscation and psychological distancing, as the potential of e-government is marginalized, and the status quo is reinforced.</p>
