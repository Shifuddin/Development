                          <p class="Para">Organizational policy making processes are complex processes in which many people are involved. Very often the results of these processes are not what the different stakeholders intended. Since policies play a major role in key decision making concerning the future of organizations, our research aims at improving the policies on the basis of collaboration.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In order to achieve this goal, we apply the practice of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">collaboration engineering</em> to the field of organizational policy making. We use the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">thinklet</em> as a basic building block for facilitating intervention to create a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">repeatable</em> pattern of collaboration among people working together towards achieving a goal. Our case studies show that policy making processes do need collaboration support indeed and that the resulting policies can be expected to improve.</p>
