                          <p class="Para">As more and more business-critical systems are based upon services deployed over flexible and dynamic platforms like Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), there is an increasing need for such services to meet their non-functional requirements like reliability, availability, security, etc. To achieve such objectives, these services need to be designed carefully making critical design decisions early in the development process on an architectural level.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In the current paper, we aim at carrying out a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">performability analysis</em> of service configurations to estimate the cost of using reliable messaging techniques for services with respect to performance. Such an analysis is enabled by automated <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">model transformations</em> carried out within the VIATRA2 framework.</p>
