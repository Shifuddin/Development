                          <p class="Para">The emerging Internet and non-Internet environments have renewed interest in flexible and adaptive communication subsystems residing in end and intermediate systems, which utilise cross layer and wider network context information. To date most cross layer solutions have been very application and/or network specific, and lack re-usability. Here we propose a common architecture to support autonomic composition of functions using generic views of information derived from lower level primitives. At its heart is a distributed Information Sensing and Sharing framework. A combination of key features of this framework are the decoupling of information collection from information use, its capability to multiplex information sources, its operational independence from any specific protocol configuration, and its use outside a node context.</p>
