                          <p class="Para">P2P network has been emerging as a very attractive content distribution mechanism. Nevertheless flooding based applications and systems with distribution hash tables based model, which are already developed, are having difficulty in the development and the application because they do not satisfy many issues such as privacy protection of end-user. In this study we propose neighbor-set based privacy protection model. The proposed technique is based on the typical distributed hash tables model, chord, and was designed to be protected from attack by securing anonymity to participating nodes. Proposed protecting scheme and how to solve the problem of load balancing caused in the process will be explained.</p>
