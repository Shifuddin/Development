                            <p class="Para">This paper addresses the problem of monitoring the compliance of privacy agreement that spells out a consumerâ€™s privacy rights and how consumer private information must be handled by the service provider. A state machine based model is proposed to describe the Private Data Use Flow (PDUF) toward monitoring which can be used by privacy analyst to observe the flow and capture privacy vulnerabilities that may lead to non-compliance. The model is built on top of (i) properties and timed-related privacy requirements to be monitored that are specified using LTL (Linear Temporal logic) (ii) a set of identified privacy misuses.</p>
