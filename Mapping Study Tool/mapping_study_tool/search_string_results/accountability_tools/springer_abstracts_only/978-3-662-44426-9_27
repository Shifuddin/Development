                          <p class="Para">This paper proposes a value-centric business model (BM) framework and development process for building suitable business models to support the planning, implementation, operation, and evaluation of mobile government (MG) applications. MG stakeholders, values, systems, services, resources, costs, performances, as well as strategies and action plans are included as components to be specified in the BM framework. To achieve the objectives of creating value for all participating parties in the mobile government environment, four stakeholder and value perspectives taken into account are public beneficiaries, government internal organizations, government service chain, as well as society and nation. Based on the BM framework and value dimensions, a business model can be created by identifying and structurally linking values, objectives, systems, services, and performance measures for all stakeholders. To direct and facilitate the launching and evaluation of mobile government programs based on a value-centric business model, an adaptive balanced scorecard (BSC) with other methods and tools are used.</p>
