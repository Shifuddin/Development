                          <p class="Para">This paper presents a prototype of a previously proposed user-centric identity management system using trusted modules. The trusted module, implemented using a smart card, can retrieve user attributes from identity providers and offer them to service providers, after authentication. This paper allows an evaluation of the practical feasibility of the identity management architecture and provides insight in several design decisions made during the prototype implementation. Also, the cryptographic protocols implemented in the prototype are discussed.</p>
