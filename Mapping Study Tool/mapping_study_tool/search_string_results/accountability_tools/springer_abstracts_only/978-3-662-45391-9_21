                            <p class="Para">Organizations have to comply with geo-location policies that prescribe geographical locations at which personal data may be stored or processed. When using cloud services, checking data geo-location policies during design-time is no longer possible - data geo-location policies need to be checked during run-time. Cloud elasticity mechanisms dynamically replicate and migrate virtual machines and services among data centers, thereby affecting the geo-location of data. Due to the dynamic nature of such replications and migrations, the actual, concrete changes to the deployment of cloud services and thus to the data geo-locations are not known. We propose a policy checking approach utilizing runtime models that reflect the deployment and interaction structure of cloud services and components. By expressing privacy policy checks as an st-connectivity problem, potential data transfers that violate the geo-location policies can be rapidly determined. We experimentally evaluate our approach with respect to applicability and performance using an SOA-version of the CoCoME case study.</p>
