                        <p class="Para">In keeping up with the idea of bringing security protocols to life, I’m going to talk about the act of trusting in interactive send-receive protocols. This class of protocols is similar to the “trust game” I presented last year, except that it does not require the existence of a dealer. Specifically, I am going to ask the question of whether it is ever safe to trust input received from an unknown sender.</p>
