                          <p class="Para">This paper discusses the role of accountability in responsibility ascriptions regarding information and communication technology (ICT). It starts with a definition of responsibility as the social construct representing the ascription of an object to a subject. Recounting the traditional responsibility, the paper will point out the weaknesses of responsibility with regards to ICT. It will then propose an alternative way of dealing with responsibility under the heading of “reflective responsibility”. Accountability will be defined as the structures and institutions that establish a link between object and subject. As such it is a necessary condition of successful responsibility ascriptions. The paper will discuss the influence of ICT on the construction of accountability and consequently on responsibility. It will highlight the problem of pathological accountability where accountability becomes reified and solidified and in effect goes counter to the social aim of responsibility. The paper will conclude with a discussion of how problems and pathologies of accountability can be overcome in order for reflective responsibility to be able to fulfil its purpose.</p>
