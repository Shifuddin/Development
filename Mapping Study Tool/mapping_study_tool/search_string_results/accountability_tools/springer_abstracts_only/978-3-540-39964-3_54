                            <p class="Para">In this paper, we propose an approach for guiding ontology managers through the modification of an ontology with respect to users’ needs. It is based on the analysis of end-users’ interactions with the ontology-based applications, which are tracked into the usage-log. Several measures taking into account the ontology hierarchy are defined. Their application on the usage log results in the set of the recommendations for the ontology improvement. The approach has been implemented in the system called OntoManager. The evaluation study shows the benefits of supporting ontology management by our approach.</p>
