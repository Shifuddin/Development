                            <p class="Para">Emerging peer to peer (P2P) applications have a requirement for decentralised access control. Computational trust systems address this, achieving security through collaboration. This paper surveys current work on overlay networks, trust and identity certification. Our focus is on the particular problem of distributing evidence for use in trust-based security decisions. We present a system we have implemented that solves this in a highly scalable way, and resists attacks such as false recommendations and collusion.</p>
