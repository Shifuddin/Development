                          <p class="Para">The requirements and technologies supporting shared health record databases pose new access control challenges. This paper proposes a decentralized access control system in which corporate policy can allow all health record owners to administer access control over their own objects, and at the same time, all objects are reasonably secure. We exploit various concepts of Rule Based Access Control, Role Based Access Control, XML structures, and object databases in our model.</p>
