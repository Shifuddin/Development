                          <p class="Para">This paper describes the use of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">semantic technologies</em> to enable a public/private communication network in the iGreen project. The motivation for using semantic technologies is outlined, and a description of the iGreen ontology-server is given, and the services this provides to users and developers. We discuss the semantic data-sets published in iGreen and the steps taken to enrich and interlink these.</p>
