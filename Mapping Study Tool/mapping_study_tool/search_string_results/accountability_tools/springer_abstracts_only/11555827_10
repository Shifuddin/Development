                        <p class="Para">We introduce the notion of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">sanitizable signatures</em> that offer many attractive security features for certain current and emerging applications. A sanitizable signature allows authorized semi-trusted censors to modify – in a limited and controlled fashion – parts of a signed message without interacting with the original signer. We present constructions for this new primitive, based on standard signature schemes and secure under common cryptographic assumptions. We also provide experimental measurements for the implementation of a sanitizable signature scheme and demonstrate its practicality.</p>
