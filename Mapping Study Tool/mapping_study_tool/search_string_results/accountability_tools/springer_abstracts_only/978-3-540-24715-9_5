                          <p class="Para">Todayâ€™s crucial information networks are vulnerable to fast-moving attacks by Internet worms and computer viruses. These attacks have the potential to cripple the Internet and compromise the integrity of the data on the end-user machines. Without new types of protection, the Internet remains susceptible to the assault of increasingly aggressive attacks. A platform has been implemented that actively detects and blocks worms and viruses at multi-Gigabit/second rates. It uses the Field-programmable Port Extender (FPX) to scan for signatures of malicious software (malware) carried in packet payloads. Dynamically reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic tracks the state of Internet flows and searches for regular expressions and fixed-strings that appear in the content of packets. Protection is achieved by the incremental deployment of systems throughout the Internet.</p>
