                          <p class="Para">We propose a new privacy model for XML data called Privacy for All (P4A) to capture collectors privacy practice and data providers privacy preferences. Through P4A data collectors specify the purpose of data collection along with recipients, retention time and users. Data providers can agree to the collectorsâ€™ practice or impose their own privacy preferences. P4A offers more flexibility to both data collectors and providers in specifying privacy statements and preferences, including but not limited to full permission, denial, and conditional access to information.</p>
                          <p class="Para">A privacy practice defines purposes, recipients, retention period, and uses of data collection. Data providers share their private information with data collectors under restrictions specified by privacy preferences. P4A offers individualsmultiple options for restrictions such as conditional access, return results as range intervals for each data item and purpose.</p>
