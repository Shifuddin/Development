                        <p class="Para">Mobile agents are programs that can be dispatched from one computer and delivered to a remote computer for execution. Arriving at the remote computer, they present their credentials and obtain access to local services and data. They also provide a single uniform paradigm for distributed object computing, encompassing synchrony and asynchrony, message-passing and object-passing, and stationary objects and mobile objects. In this paper, we describe our Java-based mobile agents called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Aglets</em> and present its programming interface, called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Java Aglet API</em>.</p>
