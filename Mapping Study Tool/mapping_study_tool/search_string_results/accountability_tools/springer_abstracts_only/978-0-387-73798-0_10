                          <p class="Para">Designing and managing an effective corporate governance structure for Virtual Breeding Environments (VBEs) is a challenging process. Therefore, a governance model is required to define operational rules, bylaws and principles that will govern the behaviour of the members of a VBE during its life cycle. VBE governance will help to define who can make what decisions, who is accountable for which effects, and how each of the VBE actors must work to operate the VBE management process effectively. This paper presents first attempts in the definition of guidelines for Governance Rules and Bylaws in VBEs.</p>
