                          <p class="Para">Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is one of the most promising research area for a future Internet. The goal is to obtain a more scalable, secure, collaborative Internet supporting context-aware services. However, as a new overlay infrastructure, CCN raises the need of a new monitoring architecture to assess security of CCN devices. In particular, the stateful nature of CCN routers introduces new attack threats that need to be addressed. We propose in this paper a monitoring approach for the instrumentation of CCN enabled network nodes. The rationale of our monitoring approach is demonstrated through real experimentations to detect and mitigate network level attacks against CCN.</p>
