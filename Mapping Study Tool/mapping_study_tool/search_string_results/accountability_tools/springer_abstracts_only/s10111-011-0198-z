                          <p class="Para">The cognitive information flow analysis (CIFA) is introduced as a method to integrate results from cognitive task and work analyses in order to provide a focus on the necessary system information flow, which includes how information is produced, consumed, and transformed by the various system functions and users. CIFA can be used as a tool to augment cognitive task and work analyses. This paper presents the CIFA technique, provides a case study that applies the CIFA method to existing goal-directed task analysis and modified cognitive work analysis results, and provides insight into CIFAâ€™s use for informing the design of a human-robot system. CIFA augments the results provided by cognitive task and work analyses and can guide system design and development. CIFA differs from existing information flow techniques in that it allows representation of systems containing large numbers of users for highly complex and uncertain domains. Existing cognitive task and work analyses integration methods rely heavily on relational tables. CIFA specifically expresses the interconnectivity of the various system subcomponents, including partial ordering and parallelism, by fundamentally focusing on the information flow. CIFA also identifies both existing and potential, information bottlenecks and highlights teamwork.</p>
