                          <p class="Para">Privacy in cloud computing is a major concern for individuals, governments, service and platform providers. In this context, the compliance with regards to policies and regulations about personal data protection is essential, but hard to achieve, as the implementation of privacy controls is subject to diverse kinds of errors. In this paper we present how the enforcement of privacy policies can be facilitated by a Platform as a Service. Cloud applications developers can use non-obtrusive annotations in the code to indicate where personally identifiable information is being handled, leveraging the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) features. Subsequently the evaluation of user defined preferences is performed by trustful components provided by the platform, liberating developers from the burden of designing custom mechanisms for privacy enforcement in their software.</p>
