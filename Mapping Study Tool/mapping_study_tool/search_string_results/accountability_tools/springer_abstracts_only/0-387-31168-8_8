                          <p class="Para">Substantial demographic changes, while centred on the number of elderly in the developed world, are forcing a radical re-evaluation of how to deliver care more effectively to all, including those with chronic conditions or disabilities. Optimizing and co-ordinating complete multi-disciplinary, multi-agency end-to-end service processes are seen as key to this. As real-time access to comprehensive care records and relevant knowledge systems is a critical enabler, the paper explores the closer integration of the patient experience as an “expert” knowledge source rather than just an “informed” one. It highlights the dependency on the effective management of change will have on such a major transformation.</p>
