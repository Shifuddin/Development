                          <p class="Para">We present a novel approach to authenticate and authorize a user, using her personal smartphone. The presented architecture is complemented with a proof-of-concept implementation. The implemented system architecture is based on a single sign-on solution (SSO), extended to allow the usage of the smartphone as authentication and authorization device. We evaluated the system within real-world scenarios, observing usersâ€™ behavior using the novel technique. Based on our experiences, we summarize advances, made both in usability and security, for novel implementations using the proposed concept.</p>
