                          <p class="Para">When events such as severe weather or congestion interfere with the normal flow of air traffic, air traffic controllers may implement plays that reroute one or more traffic flows. Currently, plays are assessed and selected based on controllersâ€™ experience using the National Playbook, a collection of plays that have worked in the past. This paper introduces PlayMaker, a CBR prototype that replicates the Playbook and models how controllers select plays. This paper describes the PlayMaker design, a model validation, and discusses developments necessary for a full-scale CBR tool for this application.</p>
