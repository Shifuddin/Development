It must be said that today the area of spatial planning is under the influence of the European INSPIRE directive. It is necessary to spread an awareness about how to build this infrastructure in terms of INSPIRE. The article describes the current ways how to build the spatial data infrastructure. Furthermore, a new approach â€“ GeoPortal4everybody, based also on using of social networking principles is proposed. Next, the paper presents using of GeoPortal4everybody concept as a part of technological framework for vocational education partially developed in the SDI-EDU project. This project aims on creating of online educational platform for spatial planners. The educational content is concentrated mainly on issues related to INSPIRE, Spatial Data Infrastructure and spatial planning. Finally the paper gives an overview of the main parts of the educational platform like GeoPortal4everybody and BizBiz tools.</p>
