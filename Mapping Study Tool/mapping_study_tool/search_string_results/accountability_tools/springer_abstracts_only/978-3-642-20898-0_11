                          <p class="Para">With the evolution of the Internet from a controlled research network to a worldwide social and economic platform, the initial assumptions regarding stakeholder cooperative behavior are no longer valid. Conflicts have emerged in situations where there are opposing interests. Previous work in the literature has termed these conflicts tussles. This article presents the research of the SESERV project, which develops a methodology to investigate such tussles and is carrying out a survey of tussles identified within the research projects funded under the Future Networks topic of the FP7. Selected tussles covering both social and economic aspects are analyzed also in this article.</p>
