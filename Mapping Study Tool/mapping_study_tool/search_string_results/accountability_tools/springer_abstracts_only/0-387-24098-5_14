                        <p class="Para">We propose a language that allows agents to distribute data with usage policies in a decentralized architecture. In our framework, the compliance with usage policies is not enforced. However, agents may be audited by an authority at an arbitrary moment in time. We design a logic that allows audited agents to prove their actions, and to prove their authorization to posses particular data. Accountability is defined in several flavors, including <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">agent</em> accountability and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">data</em> accountability. Finally, we show the soundness of the logic.</p>
