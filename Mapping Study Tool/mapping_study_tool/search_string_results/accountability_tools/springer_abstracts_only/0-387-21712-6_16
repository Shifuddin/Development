                        <p class="Para">The five-step process is useful for evaluating personal security decisions, but many security decisions involve a variety of playersâ€”each with his own agenda. Your ability to take control of important security decisions is often severely limited, but you do have some control. As a citizen, you can effect some changes in security practices with your vote. As a consumer, you effect others with your wallet. As a technologist, you can invent something that changes security. And if you have some measure of money and freedom, you can change your environment, even if that means relocating yourself. Making changes in security arrangements is also achieved through negotiation. Using mechanisms like insurance and laws that enforce liability, individuals can secure some measure of power in determining what kind of security will be available to them.</p>
