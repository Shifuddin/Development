                          <p class="Para">Any project, programme or organisation, working in any environment with released information, managing its change, maintaining traceability, and ensuring results always meet expectations, needs configuration management. Software projects introduce additional complexities â€” multiple developers working on the same item at the same time, the need for compatibility with other products and systems, targeting releases for multiple platforms, and supporting multiple versions (for example development and released versions). This paper describes the configuration management processes that support and manage products through their entire life cycle as they change and evolve.</p>
