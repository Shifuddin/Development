                          <p class="Para">The wide acceptance of the grid technology has created pressure to add some features that were not part of its original design, such as security, privacy, and quality-of-service support. In this paper, we have proposed the enhanced grid security and privacy (EGSP) system architecture including EGSP system model, identity protection system, onion routing system, reputation system, and security technology. We also present a network simulation of the model and analyze its scalability.</p>
