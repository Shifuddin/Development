                          <p class="Para">In this paper we look at the complex area of a global outsourcing delivery model among different countries and/or organizations. In this case, privacy requirements stemming from requirements of various countries of data origin need to be honoured and taken into account during the data lifecycle. We review practical privacy management challenges arising in large, global organizations and discuss technology needed to address them. As a first example we describe the design of a privacy tool built and deployed to help an organization identify and manage privacy concerns in the context of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). As a generalization of this technology we present an automated solution for scalable, accountable privacy management.</p>
