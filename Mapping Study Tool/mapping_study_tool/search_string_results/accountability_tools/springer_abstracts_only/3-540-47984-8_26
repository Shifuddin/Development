                          <p class="Para">In this article we describe the implementation of software development bug tracking via WebPT/Continuus, in a development organization of about 200 developers, testers and managers of various ranks. We emphasize the interplay of technology, procedures and human nature, and describe our experiences and lessons on how this interplay affects the continuous quality improvement process.
