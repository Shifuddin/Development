                          <p class="Para">In this work we present a new and efficient hash-and-sign signature scheme in the standard model that is based on the RSA assumption. Technically it adapts the new proof techniques that are used to prove the recent RSA scheme by Hohenberger and Waters. In contrast to the Hohenberger-Waters scheme our scheme allows to sign blocks of messages and to issue signatures on committed values, two key properties required for building privacy preserving systems.</p>
