                          <p class="Para">Current literature as well as standards that mandate requirements traceability do not provide a comprehensive model of what information should be captured and used as a part of a traceability scheme, leading to wide variation in the quality and usefulness of traceability practice across systems development efforts. In this paper, we present a framework for representing and developing a traceability scheme. The experiences of an organization using traceability as an important component of a quality software engineering process are discussed. Models describing the traceability practice in the organization, as well as issues and lessons learned, both from organizational and technical perspectives, from implementing a comprehensive traceability practice are presented.</p>
