                          <p class="Para">Delivering public services through the SMS channel is becoming popular and has demonstrated its benefits. Some of the initiatives involved big investment. However, citizens’ acceptance of the services is still an issue. This paper presents a study on user acceptance of SMS-based e-government services. It assesses the adequacy of four prominent models of technology adoption (TRA, TAM, TPB, and DTPB) to explain intention to use SMS-based egovernment services and proposes a generic model of individual acceptance of SMS-based e-government services. Constructs of the proposed model were derived from a survey on citizens’ motivations for using SMS-based egovernment services, theories on individual acceptance of technologies, and user acceptance determinants of SMS and e-government services. Data for validating the models were collected from 589 citizens in three cities in Indonesia. The proposed model may explain why individuals accept or reject SMS-based e-government services and how user acceptance is influenced by the service characteristics.</p>
