                          <p class="Para">Electronic health records enable the global availability of medical data. This has numerous benefits for the quality of offered services. However, privacy concerns may arise as now both the patient’s medical history as well as the doctor’s activities can be tracked. In this paper, we propose an electronic health record system which allows the patient to control who has access to her health records. Furthermore, provided she does not misuse the system, a doctor will remain anonymous with respect to any central authority.</p>
