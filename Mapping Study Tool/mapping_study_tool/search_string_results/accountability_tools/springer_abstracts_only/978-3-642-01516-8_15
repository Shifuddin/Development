                          <p class="Para">Information sharing has undeniably become ubiquitous in the Internet age. The global village created on the Internet provides people with instant access to information and news on events occurring in a remote area, including access to video content on websites such as <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">YouTube</em>. Thus, the Internet has helped us overcome barriers to information. However, we cannot conceive an event happening in a remote area and respond to it with relevant actions in a real-time fashion. To overcome this problem, we propose a system called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Askus</em>, a mobile platform for supporting networked actions. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Askus</em> facilitates an extension of the conceivable space and action by including humans in the loop. In <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Askus</em>, a personâ€™s request is transmitted to a suitable person who will then act in accordance with the request at a remote site. Based on a diary study that led to detailed understanding about mobile assistance needs in everyday life, we developed the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Askus</em> platform and implemented the PC-based and mobile phone-based prototypes. We also present the results from our preliminary field trial.</p>
