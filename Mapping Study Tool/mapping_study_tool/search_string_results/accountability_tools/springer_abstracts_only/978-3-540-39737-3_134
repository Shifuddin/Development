                          <p class="Para">ISO/IEC TR 15504, the Software Process Improvement Capability Determination (SPICE), provides a framework for the assessment of software processes. This framework can be used by organizations involved in planning, monitoring, controlling, and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution and support of software. But, in the ISO/IEC TR 15504, considerations for security are relatively poor to others. For example, the considerations for security related to software development and developer are lacked. In this paper we propose a process related to security by comparing ISO/IEC TR 15504 to ISO/IEC 21827 and ISO/IEC 15408. The proposed scheme may be contributed to the improvement of security for IT product or system.</p>
