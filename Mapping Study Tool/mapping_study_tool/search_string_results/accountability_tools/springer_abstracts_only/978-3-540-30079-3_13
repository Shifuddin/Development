                          <p class="Para">The management and enforcement of privacy obligations is a challenging task: it involves legal, organizational, behavioral and technical aspects. This area is relevant for enterprises and government agencies that deal with personal identity information. Privacy and data protection laws already regulate some of the related aspects. Technical work has been done for the management of obligations subordinated to authorization aspects and simple data retention obligations: however, dealing with ongoing and long-term aspects of obligations is still a green field and open to research. This paper explores and analyses the explicit management of privacy obligations for identity information. It focuses on technical aspects even if the problem cannot be solved only by deploying technological solutions. Mechanisms are required to represent, manage, monitor and enforce obligation policies in complex and heterogeneous environments. Our research is work in progress: we illustrate some of our technical work and investigations in this space.</p>
