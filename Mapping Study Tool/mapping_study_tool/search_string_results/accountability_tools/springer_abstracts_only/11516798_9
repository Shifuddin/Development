                          <p class="Para">Both the scientific and business communities, which are beginning to rely on Grids as problem-solving mechanisms, have requirements in terms of provenance. The provenance of some data is the documentation of process that led to the data; its necessity is apparent in fields ranging from medicine to aerospace. To support provenance capture in Grids, we have developed an implementation-independent protocol for the recording of provenance. We describe the protocol in the context of a service-oriented architecture and formalise the entities involved using an abstract state machine or a three-dimensional state transition diagram. Using these techniques we sketch a liveness property for the system.</p>
