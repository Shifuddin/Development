                          <p class="Para">This chapter introduces an architecture for privacy-enhancing identity management. The architecture can be used as a blueprint for building a comprehensive system with a plurality of players for privacy-enhancing identity management. It elaborates on how to integrate state-of-the-art privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) to achieve the goals as outlined below. Important concepts realized by our architecture have been put forth in the European data protection regulation, particularly the European Data Protection Directive [Eur95] and its implementations in the EC member statesâ€™ data protection laws. Those foundational concepts include data minimization, data quality, transparency, the finality principle, and subject access to data.</p>
