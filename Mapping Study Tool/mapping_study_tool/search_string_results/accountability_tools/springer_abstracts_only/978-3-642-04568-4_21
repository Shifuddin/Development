                          <p class="Para">This paper addresses the general problem of how classical cluster of industries can become a Virtual Breeding Environment (VBE). Using reference frameworks and models, a methodology to support this evolution is being conceived and its preliminary results are presented. This work tackles a cluster of moulds and dies industries from Brazil as the basis for the research and propositions. In the future, this methodology intends to serve as a concrete mean to systematize the implementation of a variety of VBEs.</p>
