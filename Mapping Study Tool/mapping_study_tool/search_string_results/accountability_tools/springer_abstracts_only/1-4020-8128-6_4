                          <p class="Para">In [1] we have presented our initial investigations into the delegation of obligations and the concept of review as one kind of organisational principle to control such delegation activities. However, this initial approach was too simplistic and failed to explain how a principal may be related to an obligation; how obligations relate to roles; and how the delegation of specific and general obligations may be controlled through the concepts of review and supervision. As a result, we presented a more detailed and refined analysis of organisational controls in the context of a formal framework [2]. This paper summarises some of our investigations.</p>
