                          <p class="Para">This paper concerns the applicability of reputations systems for assessing Quality of Experience (QoE) for web services in the Future Internet. Reputation systems provide mechanisms to manage subjective opinions in societies and yield a general scoring of a particular behavior. Thus, they are likely to become an important ingredient of the Future Internet. Parameters under evaluation by a reputation system may vary greatly and, particularly, may be chosen to assess the users’ satisfaction with (composite) web services. Currently, this satisfaction is usually expressed by QoE, which represents subjective users’ opinions. The goal of this paper is to present a novel framework of web services where a reputation system is incorporated for tracking and predicting of users’ satisfaction. This approach is a beneficial tool which enables providers to facilitate service adaptation according to users’ expectations and maintain QoE at a satisfactory level. Presented reputation systems operate in an environment of composite services that integrate client and server-side. This approach is highly suitable for effective QoE differentiating and maximizing user experience for specific customer profiles as even the service and network resources are shared.</p>
