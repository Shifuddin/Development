                          <p class="Para">Hospitals strive to improve the quality of the healthcare they provide. To achieve this, they require access to health data. These data are sensitive since they contain personal information. Governments have legislation to ensure that privacy is respected and hospitals must comply with it. Unfortunately, most of the procedures meant to control access to health information remain paper-based, making it difficult to trace. In this paper, we introduce a framework based on the User Requirements Notation that models the business processes of a hospital and links them with legislation such as the Ontario Personal Health Information Privacy Act (PHIPA). We analyze different types of links, their functionality, and usefulness in complying with privacy law. This framework will help health information custodians track compliance and indicate how their business processes can be improved.</p>
