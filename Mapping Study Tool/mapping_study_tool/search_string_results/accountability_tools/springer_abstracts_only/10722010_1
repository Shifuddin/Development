                        <p class="Para">Current program development environments provide excellent support for many desirable aspects of modern software applications such as performance and interoperability, but almost no support for features that could directly enhance correctness and reliability. In this talk, I will describe the first steps that we are making in a project to develop a new kind of program development environment. Our goal is to produce a tool that actively supports and encourages its users in thinking about, stating, and validating key properties of software as an integral part of the programming process.</p>
