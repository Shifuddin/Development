                        <p class="Para">Two central issues related to computer assisted instructional (CAI) systems are discussed. First, we discuss logistics management and integrated logistics support for the life-cycle of a CAI product included in an automatic test system. A description of a proposed prototype CAI system is included in the second portion of this paper. This discussion includes a description of preliminary, demonstration systems along with features to be included during the next two years. The underlying theme in the discussion is that both of these issues must be treated simultaneously.</p>
                        <p class="Para">The broader implications of this research (including management science, artificially intelligent instructional systems, and models of human cognition), are also discussed.</p>
