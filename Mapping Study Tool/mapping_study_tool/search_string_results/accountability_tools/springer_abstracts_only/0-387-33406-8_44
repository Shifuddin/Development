                          <p class="Para">In this paper we describe a system for allocating computational resources to distributed applications and services (within distributed data centres and utility computing systems) in order to perform operations on personal or confidential data in a way that is compliant with associated privacy policies. Relevant privacy policies are selected on the fly, based on related meta-policies, depending on contextual information (potentially including location) and properties of the resources. One or more Trusted Privacy Services are involved to mediate the access to the data, based on the satisfaction of pertinent policies. Resources might be equipped with trusted computing components (e.g. Trusted Platform Modules [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1</a></span>]) to provide higher assurance and trust about the contextual statements or properties of these resources (such as their location, their status and integrity, etc.).</p>
