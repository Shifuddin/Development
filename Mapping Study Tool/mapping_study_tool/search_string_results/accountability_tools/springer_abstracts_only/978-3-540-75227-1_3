                        <p class="Para">We propose a semantic paradigm for component-based specification supporting the documentation of security risk behaviour. By security risk, we mean behaviour that constitutes a risk with regard to ICT security aspects, such as confidentiality, integrity and availability. The purpose of this work is to investigate the nature of security risk in the setting of component-based system development. A better understanding of security risk at the level of components facilitates the prediction of risks related to introducing a new component into a system. The semantic paradigm provides a first step towards integrating security risk analysis into the system development process.</p>
