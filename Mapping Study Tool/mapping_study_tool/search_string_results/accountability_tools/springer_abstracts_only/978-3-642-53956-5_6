                          <p class="Para">This position paper presents research work involving the development of a publicly available <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Realistic Synthetic Electronic Healthcare Record</em> (RS-EHR). The paper presents PADARSER, a novel approach in which the real <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Electronic Healthcare Record</em> (EHR) and neither authorization nor anonymisation are required in generating the synthetic EHR data sets. The <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">GRiSER method</em> is presented for use in PADARSER to allow the RS-EHR to be synthesized for statistically significant localised synthetic patients with statistically prevalent <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">medical conditions</em> based upon information found from publicly available data sources. In treating the synthetic patient within the GRiSER method, clinical workflow or <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">careflows</em> (Cfs) are derived from <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Clinical Practice Guidelines</em> (CPGs) and the standard local practices of clinicians. The Cfs generated are used together with health statistics, CPGs, medical coding and terminology systems to generate coded synthetic RS-EHR entries from statistically significant observations, treatments, tests, and procedures. The RS-EHR is thus populated with a complete medical history describing the resulting events from treating the medical conditions. The strength of the PADARSER approach is its use of publicly available information. The strengths of the GRiSER method are that (1) it does not require the use of the real EHR for generating the coded RS-EHR entries; and (2) the generic components for obtaining careflow from CPGs and for generating coded RS-EHR entries are applicable in other areas such as knowledge transfer and EHR user interfaces respectively.</p>
