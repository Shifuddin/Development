                          <p class="Para">Many anonymous applications offer unconditional anonymity to their users. However, this can provoke abusive behavior. Dissatisfied users will drop out or liability issues may even force the system to suspend or cease its services. Therefore, controlling abuse is as important as protecting the anonymity of legitimate users. However, designing such applications is no sinecure. This paper presents a methodology for designing controlled anonymous environments. The methodology generates a conceptual model that compromises between privacy requirements and control requirements. The conceptual model allows to derive performance and trust properties and easily maps to control mechanisms.</p>
