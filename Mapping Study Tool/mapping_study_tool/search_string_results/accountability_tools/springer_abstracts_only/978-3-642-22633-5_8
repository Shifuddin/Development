                          <p class="Para">This paper presents <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">BBox</span>, a digital black box to provide for authentic archiving in distributed systems. Based upon public key cryptography and trusted computing platforms, the <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">BBox</span> employs standard primitives to ensure the authenticity of records during the transmission from devices to the collector, as well as during their storage on the collector and retrieval by auditors. Besides presenting the technical underpinnings of the <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">BBox</span>, this paper demonstrates the authenticity guarantees it ensures and reports on the preliminary deployment figures.</p>
