                          <p class="Para">A real but typical case of identity fraud is used to open up the complex web of identification systems in Brazil. It is argued that identification has two poles related to the nature of citizenship—repression and inclusion—and that reactions from citizens to new identification schemes can be attributed to how they view the purpose of the cards in these terms.

However, this may be undermined by the lack of state preparation for an information society, particularly the absence of meaningful data protection laws.</p>
