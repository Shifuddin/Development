                            <p class="Para">To preserve fraud detection, in most current eHealth systems, the health information of patients is fully disclosed to the insurance companies which cover the expenses of the patientsâ€™ health care. However, such disclosure might infringe on the privacy of the patients. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudonym scheme and corresponding signature scheme for the billing process, in order to protect the privacy of patients against insurance companies while enabling the latter to check the truthfulness of the bills.</p>
