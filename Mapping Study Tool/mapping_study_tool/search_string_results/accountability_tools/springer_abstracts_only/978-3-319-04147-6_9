                        <p class="Para">We assume that those charged with public safety and security act in the public interest. Generally this is the case. However, as the Holloway Road incident and Hillsborough cover-up demonstrate, sometimes public servants act in their own interests. Using actor-network and other sociological theories the author demonstrates how such deviant behaviour is organised and maintained. Several lessons are drawn. For example, that police statements should not be privileged over other types of witness statement. Also, that public servants, their representatives and Members of Parliament are not above using the gutter press to propagate false accounts. Finally, that the truth is sometimes distorted through the application of crude stereotypes. The Holloway Road incident and Hillsborough cover-up teach an important lessonâ€”that effective checks-and-balances on the power of the State are essential for the safeguarding of liberty and justice. Such checks-and-balances include a free press and accessible and timely decision-review systems.
