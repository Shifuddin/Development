                          <p class="Para">The introduction of regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley act requires companies to ensure that appropriate controls are implemented in their business applications. Implementing and validating compliance measures in ‘agile’ companies is time consuming, costly, error-prone and a maintenance-intensive task. This paper presents an approach towards dynamically adapting a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) such that business applications remain compliant. In order to ensure compliance, a compliance checking mechanism for the SOA is needed. Upon detection of a threat/violation, the components of a business application are adapted using aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In this paper, we discuss the fundamental problems and we give an architectural description of our approach.</p>
