                          <p class="Para">This paper tries to serve as an introductory reading to privacy issues in the field of ubiquitous computing. It develops six principles for guiding system design, based on a set of fair information practices common in most privacy legislation in use today: notice, choice and consent, proximity and locality, anonymity and pseudonymity, security, and access and recourse. A brief look at the history of privacy protection, its legal status, and its expected utility is provided as a background.</p>
