                          <p class="Para">Security is generally believed to be a very important topic. However, during software development security requirements are hardly ever properly treated, least of all on the conceptual level. Security is considered as some kind of add-on which will be applied to the system after development. To fill this gap we work on the development of a conceptual security modeling method we refer to as CoSMo <span class="EmphasisTypeUnderline ">(Co</span>nceptual <span class="EmphasisTypeUnderline ">S</span>ecurity <span class="EmphasisTypeUnderline ">Mo</span>deling). In this paper first a comprehensive summary of available security modeling methodologies is presented. Second, various security requirements and mechanisms which are necessary for building secure software systems are described systematically to give a clear distinction between requirements and mechanisms to enforce the security requirements. Finally, a modeling example is given to illustrate particular security requirements and mechanisms.</p>
