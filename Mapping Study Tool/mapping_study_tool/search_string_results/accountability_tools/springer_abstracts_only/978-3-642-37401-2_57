                          <p class="Para">VANET has some prominent features such as channel-opening, large-scale, fast, dynamic-changing, so there is some misbehavior vehicles. Due to the large number of vehicles, even if there is only 1% percent of misbehavior vehicles, there can be thousands of misbehavior vehicles. How to identify these vehicles quickly, and then use appropriate cancellation and isolation measures to reduce system losses to its minimum and controllable range. In this paper, we propose MisDis, a method that can identify misbehavior vehicle by implementing state automata and supervision, as well as a special security log to record the behavioral characteristics of the target vehicle. If the host vehicle violates the established security policy, then the system need to record the behavioral and try to dump to a safer roadside unit or department in charge.</p>
