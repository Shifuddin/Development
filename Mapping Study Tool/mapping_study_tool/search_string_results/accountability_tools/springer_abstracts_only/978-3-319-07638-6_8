                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we are interested in designing a novel approach to financial learning and saving for the unbanked and under-banked populations in emerging economies, more specifically in Brazil. Despite efforts by governments, non-profits and privately held banks, unbanked and under-banked populations remain prone to unfavorable financial habits and are ill equipped to utilize financial services. In proposing new modes of engagement with the topic of financial literacy and saving, we evaluate 1) social and behavioral aspects of financial lives of said populations 2) productive learning models 3) results from an ethnographic study, to finally demonstrate potential applications.</p>
