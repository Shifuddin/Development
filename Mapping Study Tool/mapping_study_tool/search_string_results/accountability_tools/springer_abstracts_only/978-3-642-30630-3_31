                          <p class="Para">In this paper we reflect upon the challenges and constraints of a DTN infrastructure handling space data and propose a suitable security architecture for offering security services. The security requirements are expressed in terms of architecture components and supporting security processes. The architecture is provided as a point of reference for validating and evaluating future security controls and processes suitable for space data DTN environments.</p>
