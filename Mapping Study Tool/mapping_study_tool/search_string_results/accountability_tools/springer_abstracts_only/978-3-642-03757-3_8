                          <p class="Para">In this article, we proceed by pointing out some significant events in the history of information systems that have contributed to the phenomenon which causes users to experience computerized systems as agents. Some issues discussed in relation to the phenomenon are the creation of master files (all data of one object class was collected together) and the use of integrated databases (multiple master files were integrated to an integrated conceptual schema). The increasingly intertwined functions of storing, processing, and transmission confused the picture further. Finally, we try to trace the reason to this tendency to animate or anthropomorphize information systems. A review of textbooks through historic periods is used to get support or counter-arguments to this hypothesis. We will also look into agentization and unintended subjectification of computer artifacts, and consider whether they have an impact on todayâ€™s concept of the computer as an agent.</p>
