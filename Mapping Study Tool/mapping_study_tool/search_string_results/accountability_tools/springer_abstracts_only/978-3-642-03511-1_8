                        <p class="Para">Vehicular <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ad hoc</em> networks (VANETs) will improve traffic safety and efficiency provided that car-to-car communication stays trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the information conveyed by vehicle-generated messages is reliable. A sensible option is to request that the content of a message originated by a certain vehicle be endorsed by nearby peer vehicles. However, neither message generation nor message endorsement should entail any privacy loss on the part of vehicles co-operating in it. This chapter surveys the available solutions to this security-privacy tension and analyzes their limitations. A new privacy-preserving system is sketched which guarantees message authentication through both <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a priori</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">a posteriori</em> countermeasures.</p>
