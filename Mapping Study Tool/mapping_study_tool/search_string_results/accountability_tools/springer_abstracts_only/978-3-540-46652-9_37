                          <p class="Para">Many workflow models treat digital signatures in a most primitive way without considering their different uses in different situations. Some signature requirements in a workflow cannot be met or require a lot of extra work to archive by these primitive implementations. There is a need to develop different handling methods for different signature purposes in order to handle the requirements efficiently. In this paper, implementation and integration of the different signature purposes will be discussed through a case of the real world usage.</p>
