                          <p class="Para">In ubiquitous computing environments, a user can utilize a certain service in anywhere and anytime using any devices, then authentication and authorization are crucial for security in pervasive computing. In this paper, we propose a new ID-based access control model adequate for ubiquitous computing. We eliminate the use of X.509 certificates of trusted parties for authentication and allow ID-based authority delegations for flexible access control in distributed networks. We implement our proposed model using a bilinear map such as Weil pairing, and we prove the security of the proposed model against chosen-message attack under the random oracle model.</p>
