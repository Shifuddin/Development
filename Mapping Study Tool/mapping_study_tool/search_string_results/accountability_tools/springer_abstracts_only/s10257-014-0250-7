                        <p class="Para">Electronic health record (EHR) implementations involve changes to core organizational processes, and management of these changes is critical to the success of such implementation efforts. This research describes how process change issues relate to implementation of large IT projects in healthcare settings. Specifically, we draw on extant literature and conduct directed content analysis on project reports by past HIMSS Davies Award recipients to present process change related best practices occurring in EHR implementations. The results from this study can influence implementation strategies for future health information technology implementation efforts in the healthcare sector.</p>
