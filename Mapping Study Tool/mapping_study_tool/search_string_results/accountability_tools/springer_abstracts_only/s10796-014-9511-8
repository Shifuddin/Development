                          <p class="Para">Many large transformation projects do not result in the outcomes desired or envisioned by the stakeholders. This type of project is characterised by dynamics which are both caused by and result of uncertainties and unexpected behaviour. In this paper a complex adaptive system (CAS) view was adopted in order to better understand project dynamics and identify management principles for dealing with them. A case study of a large transformation project in the Netherlands was carried out, in which six patterns were found through which project dynamics could be identified. A logical consequence of the immense complexity of the case studyâ€™s project dynamics was that stakeholders lost sight of the overall goals, focussed on managing incidents and approached the project in an ad hoc way. Informed by CAS theory, we present seven management principles that respect the dynamics of this type of project and can aid in coping with project dynamics.</p>
