                          <p class="Para">Electronic Government has proven a watershed in the domain of Public Administration, despite being difficult to pin down precisely. Indeed, the Government-to-Government arena is one of the least studied aspects of this newly established field of knowledge, despite its importance in fostering cooperation and collaboration between government agencies, mainly with respect to the management of their knowledge, in order to increase the effectiveness of Public Administration. This paper aims to present the key success factors needed to implement government-to-government endeavours effectively. The research design used in this article was largely drawn from a Government-to-Government case study successfully implemented in Brazil.</p>
