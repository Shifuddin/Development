                          <p class="Para">Publishing a product in a mobile app store implies a process that makes a software product accessible to millions of users. Developers require the means to evaluate the quality of the mobile software product from a viewpoint that considers the mobile business, users, target platforms and app stores. In this paper, we surveyed the publishing guidelines of six major app stores to identify the most important software quality requirements set upon mobile apps. We leveraged the ISO/IEC 25010 quality standard as a mechanism to assure the fulfillment of the quality requirements from the mobile app stores, and we defined an association between such requirements and the characteristics of the quality standard. Finally, we introduced a Mobile App Quality Model, which aims to provide a reference to assure the development of mobile-specific, marketcompliant mobile software applications.</p>
