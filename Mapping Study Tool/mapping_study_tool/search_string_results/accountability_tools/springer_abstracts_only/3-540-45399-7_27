                          <p class="Para">In this paper we outline an architecture and design principles to support the validation of conceptual models by generation of explanations in natural language. The architecture utilises the concept of analysis patterns as a context for explaining implicit dependencies between different parts of the model. In addition Toulminâ€™s argumentation model is used to structure the interaction between user and system. We argue that this architecture assists in building explanation generation systems that are highly interactive and provide an adequate amount of information for different user categories.</p>
