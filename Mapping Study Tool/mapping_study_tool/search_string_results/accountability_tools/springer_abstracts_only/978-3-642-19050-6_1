                          <p class="Para">The PRIME project demonstrates the viability of privacy-enhancing identity management. By this we mean identity management solutions that manage the individualâ€™s identity online and that also empower the individual to actively protect their own privacy.</p>
                          <p class="Para">The guiding principle in the PRIME project is to put individuals in control of their personal data. The notion of user control has been adopted in many recent user-centric identity management initiatives.</p>
                          <p class="Para">However, most of these initiatives only takes the first steps on the way to a new generation of identity management systems. They do not provide adequate safeguards for personal data and are limited in giving individuals control over their personal data. Effective management of information privacy requires new tools starting with the minimisation of personal data disclosure. Furthermore, users can be empowered with tools that allow them to negotiate privacy policies with service providers. This would require systems that enforce agreed policies by technical means, and keep track of data collection and usage. In addition to user side applications, service providers will be required to put adequate protection mechanisms in place and align business processes to take advantage of these mechanisms.</p>
