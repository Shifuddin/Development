                        <p class="Para">We consider the ontological modeling of knowledge concerning the class of linked economic crimes, namely the fraudulent disbursement accompanied by money laundering. The applied method of conceptual modeling results in obtaining a layered ontological structure with the foundational ontology on top of it and the application ontology at its bottom. As the foundational level we use the constructive descriptions and situations ontology. The application level entities were manually separated from the motivating crime scenarios. The latter level covers both the conceptualization of ”a domain” whose attributes and relations are of interest and ”a task” that supports the realization of the functionality of a crime analysis application. The domain-based part of the ontology is engineered in the OWL language while the task-based part, designed to support knowledge extraction from databases, is implemented via rules in the SWRL language. The rules are used to extract data concerning: documents and their attributes, the formal hierarchy in a company and the parameters of transactions. They are also used to deduce sanctions against people engaged in a crime.</p>
