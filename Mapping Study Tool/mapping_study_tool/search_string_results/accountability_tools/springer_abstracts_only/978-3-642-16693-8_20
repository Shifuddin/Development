                          <p class="Para">Nowadays, there are more and more service agents which provide variety of sensor services (Global USN). Assuming many agents implement the different applications in the different locations (e.g. e-healthcare, temperature system, camera system, etc.). In practical, service agents have to prepare too costly infrastructure to enhance the applications. When cloud service is growing rapidly, we propose a cloud service provider which gathers all sensors, applications from each agent to become the sufficient services. In this paper, we propose a system which combines all global USN Services to produce many enhanced services. Moreover, we propose a security mechanism for our proposed system as well.</p>
