                        <p class="Para">Resulting from projects launched by the European Commission within the fifth framework such as ISHTAR, TrustHealth, Euromed-ETS or MERDSEC, a security infrastructure has been implemented for enabling trustworthy communication and co-operation between healthcare applications. This security infrastructure consists of Health Professional Cards (<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9">HPC</a></span>) as security tokens and a Trusted Third Party (TTP) providing the Public Key Infrastructure needed for the asymmetric kryptographic algorithms used for security services based on digital signatures such as strong authentication, integrity check, accountability but also for session key exchange. The solutions implemented are solely based on international standards. The generic security solution has been applied to establish a trustworthy healthcare network for seamless care of cancer patients. This shared care application enables the exchange of partial or complete Electronic Healthcare Records (EHCR) in oncology but also queries and statistical analysis about entities etc. The solution is used to support administration of cancer patients, clinical studies, education, research and development, but also quality assurance and optimisation of diagnosis and treatment.</p>
