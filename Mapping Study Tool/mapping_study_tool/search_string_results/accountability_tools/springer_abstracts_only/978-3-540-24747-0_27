                          <p class="Para">This position paper describes work on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">trust assumptions</em> in the context of security requirements. We show how trust assumptions can affect the scope of the analysis, derivation of security requirements, and in some cases how functionality is realized. An example shows how trust assumptions are used by a requirements engineer to help define and limit the scope of analysis and to document the decisions made during the process.</p>
