                          <p class="Para">Module-intensive user-interactive technology towards developing Internet-based communication has become instrumental in implementing actuation sequences of a remotely located mechatronic device. Bi-directional data communication metrics, hitherto dominated largely by text-based formats, has attained substantial up-gradation whereby global access vis-à-vis exchange of technical data has become a boon for the Internet users at large. However, presence of a common web-server in the communication loop has been indispensable till date. The present work reports a novel technique, whereby the web-server is bypassed and the web-enability is ensured by means of peer-to-peer socket communication between the client and the host <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">in situ</em>. The paper delineates algorithm of a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">new protocol</em> and developmental semantics of the end-hardware for web-enabled communication in order to successfully orchestrate various domains of traditional client–server handshaking in a meaningful and synergistic manner. The developed protocol encompasses programming semantics of web-enabled <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">applets</em>, formulation logistics and portability issues over the Internet. The paper presents the real-life testing sequences for remote activation of a table-top robotic manipulator successively in a Local Area Network (LAN) and also in a Wide Area Network (WAN) and finally through the Internet, using a dedicated web-site.</p>
