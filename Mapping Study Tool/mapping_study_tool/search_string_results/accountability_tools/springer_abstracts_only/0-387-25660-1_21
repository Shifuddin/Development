                          <p class="Para">Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attackers typically use spoofed IP addresses to prevent exposing their identities and easy filtering of attack traffic. This paper introduces a novel mitigation scheme, TRAPS, whereby the victim verifies source address authenticity by performing reconfiguration for traffic redirection and informing high ongoing-traffic correspondents. The spoofed sources are not informed and will continue to use the old configuration to send packets, which can then be easily filtered off. Adaptive rate-limiting can be used on the remaining traffic, which may be attack packets with randomly-generated spoofed IP addresses. We compare our various approaches for achieving TRAPS functionality. The end-host approach is based on standard Mobile IP protocol and does not require any new protocols, changes to Internet routers, nor prior traffic flow characterizations. It supports adaptive, real-time and automatic responses to DDoS attacks. Experiments are conducted to provide proof of concept.</p>
