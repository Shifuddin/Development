                        <p class="Para">In this paper, we introduce Attribute-Based Signatures with User-Controlled Linkability <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">(ABS-UCL)</span>. Attribute-based signatures allow a signer who has enough credentials/attributes to anonymously sign a message w.r.t. some public policy revealing neither the attributes used nor his identity. User-controlled linkability is a new feature which allows a user to make some of his signatures directed at the same recipient linkable while still retaining anonymity. Such a feature is useful for many real-life applications. We give a general framework for constructing <span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">ABS-UCL</span> and present an efficient instantiation of the construction that supports multiple attribute authorities.</p>
