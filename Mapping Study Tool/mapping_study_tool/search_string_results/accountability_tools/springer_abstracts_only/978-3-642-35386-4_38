                        <p class="Para">With social networks evolving and integrating within traditional policy domains, the question arises - do we have in our hands a tool for genuine participation, transparency and dialogue, or are the concerns surrounding privacy, trust, provenance and localization still haunting and shaping the arena? In this paper, we discuss this very question via the illustrative lens of the WeGov Project. We start by providing a critical rethinking of e-governance within the context of social media. We then move onto an in depth look at the WeGov project, its toolkit, end-user engagement strategies and methodologies. Finally we draw from our findings some critical insights into the impacts on and implications of such technologies for the policy-making environment. We conclude with a set of recommendations for future work in this area as well as a summary of key lessons learnt within this innovative initiative.</p>
