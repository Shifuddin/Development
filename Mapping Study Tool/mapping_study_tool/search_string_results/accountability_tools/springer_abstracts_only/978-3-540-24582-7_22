                          <p class="Para">Recently, making Internet credit-card payment is widely accepted. Several payment protocols have been proposed to secure the credit-card payment on fixed networks. However, these protocols do not apply well to wireless networks due to the limitations of wireless devices and wireless networks themselves. In this paper, we propose a simple and powerful credit-card payment protocol for wireless networks. We implement a secure cryptographic technique that works well under this protocol. We show that our proposed protocol is more suitable for applying to wireless networks than SET and iKP in that client’s computation is reduced. The protocol also satisfies all security properties provided by both SET and iKP. Moreover, it offers the ability to resolve disputes and recover from failures which are normally occurred in wireless environment. Furthermore, client’s credit-card information is not required to be sent in the protocol. It results in the security enhancement of the system.</p>
