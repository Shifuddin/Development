                          <p class="Para">Wikis are popular tools for creation and sharing of content. Integrated reputation systems allow to assess expertise and reliability of authors and thus to support trust in the wiki content. Yet, results from our empirical study indicate that the disclosure of user reputation evokes privacy issues. As a solution for this conflict between the need to evaluate trustworthiness of users and protecting their privacy, we present a privacy-respecting reputation system for wikis that we realized as OpenSource-Extension for the wiki software MediaWiki.</p>
