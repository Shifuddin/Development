                        <p class="Para">A large number of papers on verifiable electronic voting that have appeared in the literature in recent years have relied heavily on the availability of an <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">append-only web bulletin board</em>. Despite this widespread requirement, however, the notion of an append-only web bulletin board remains somewhat vague, and no method of constructing such a bulletin board has been proposed.</p>
                        <p class="Para">This paper fills the gap. We identify the required properties of an append-only web bulletin board, and introduce the concept of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">certified publishing</em> of messages to the board. We show how such a board can be constructed in order to satisfy the properties we have identified.</p>
                        <p class="Para">Finally, we consider how to extend the scheme to make the web bulletin board robust and able to offer assurance to writers of the inclusion of their messages.</p>
                        <p class="Para">Although the work presented here has been inspired and motivated by the requirements of electronic voting systems, the web bulletin board is sufficiently general to allow use in other contexts.</p>
