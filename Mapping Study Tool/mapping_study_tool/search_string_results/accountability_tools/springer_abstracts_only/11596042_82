                          <p class="Para">A survey on location authentication protocols and spatial-temporal attestation services is presented. Several protocols and services with these objectives have been proposed during the last decade, but still there is a lack of understanding of the security properties they should provide and which security mechanisms are appropriate. We first define the goals and threat model of location authentication protocols, next they are described and analyzed against this model. Also, spatial-temporal attestation services are described and classified depending on their goal and kind of issued evidence.</p>
