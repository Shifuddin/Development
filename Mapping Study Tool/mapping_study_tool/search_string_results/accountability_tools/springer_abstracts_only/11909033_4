                        <p class="Para">Disaster management using mobile telecommunication networks provides a new and attractive possibility to save human lives in emergencies. With this contribution, we present a possible disaster management system based on mobile telecommunication. In order to use such a system in the real world, security requirements such as availability, accountability, integrity and confidentiality have to be ensured by the disaster management system (DMS). We summarize these requirements and propose ways of addressing them with a multilateral secure approach. Using electronic signatures based on SIM-cards, we assure integrity, accountability and confidentiality of the notification messages. We also discuss how availability could be increased.</p>
