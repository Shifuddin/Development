                        <p class="Para">Event logging and log files are playing an important role in system and network security. Log files record computer system activities, are used to provide requirements of reliability, security and accountability applications. Information stored in log files can be obtained from different devices, not necessarily clock synchronized, and they do not arrive in the same order they are generated. Nevertheless, log information has to be coherent in time to be useful. To support the events we propose to use Lamportâ€™s logic clocks, originated at different sources, in a causal relationship. As a result the administrator will count all the events involved general idea in a computer incident. A model implementation is also presented.</p>
