                        <p class="Para">Attribute-based access control (ABAC) provides a high level of flexibility that promotes security and information sharing. ABAC policy mining algorithms have potential to significantly reduce the cost of migration to ABAC, by partially automating the development of an ABAC policy from information about the existing access-control policy and attribute data. This paper presents an algorithm for mining ABAC policies from operation logs and attribute data. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first algorithm for this problem.</p>
