                          <p class="Para">Ontology engineering is far from trivial and most collaborative methods and tools start from a predefined set of rules, stakeholders can have in the ontology engineering process. We, however, believe that the different types of user behavior are not known a priori and depend on the ontology engineering project. The detection of such user profiles based on unsupervised learning allows finding roles and responsibilities along peers in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we present a method for automatic detection of user profiles in a collaborative ontology engineering environment by means of the K-means clustering algorithm only by looking at the type of interactions a user makes. In this paper we use the GOSPL ontology engineering tool and method to demonstrate this method. The data used to demonstrate the method stems from two ontology engineering projects involving respectively 42 and 36 users.</p>
