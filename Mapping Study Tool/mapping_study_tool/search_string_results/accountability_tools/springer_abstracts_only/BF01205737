                          <p class="Para">This paper investigates empowerment within manufacturing production. Empowerment is multidimensional. Understanding the implications of operationalising empowerment requires an appreciation of all its dimensions. These dimensions are captured in Empowerment Profiles, which are incorporated within a conceptual framework. A sample of the Empowerment Profiles is validated using case studies. The Empowerment Profiles appear to have potential as a tool to assist in preparing to implement empowered work strategies, focusing attention on issues to be considered.</p>
