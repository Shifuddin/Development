                          <p class="Para">How well the privacy policy follows a regulation is one of the current concerns of the user. Such a task can be accomplished by directly querying the policy statement with the regulation text. Automation of the process requires an expressive meaning-based framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper discusses the Ontological Semantics approach to the issue of verifying compliance and illustrates the potential of utilizing the framework in the domain of Privacy management for NLP-related tasks. As an example a section from BCBS and corresponding HIPAA regulations are used.</p>
