                            <p class="Para">The paper presents a novel technique to combat smart adaptive attacks in ad-hoc wireless networks where battery power and bandwidth are scarce. Nodes in ad-hoc wireless networks can assume the roles of transmitters, receivers, and/or routers in case they fall geographically between two communicating nodes. Malicious nodes deviate from the standard communications protocols to illegally maximize their share of the bandwidth and save their battery power for their own communication. When the malicious node has data packets to transmit, it increases the power of the transmitted signal to increase the throughput and reduce the delay and retransmission attempts. This behavior adversely affects the rest of the nodes that follow the standard communication protocols. When the malicious node receives a packet that is not destined to it, the malicious node forwards the packet with very low transmission power level to save power and in this case, the packet reaches the next hop without enough signal strength to be decoded correctly. In this type of sophisticated attacks, malicious nodes deal with the control packets according to the standards so it keeps itself visible inside the network in case there are packets destined to it. Our end-to-end algorithm detects and isolates those types of attackers to maintain the resiliency of the network against the malicious behavior.</p>
