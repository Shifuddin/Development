                            <p class="Para">In existing security model-checkers the intruderâ€™s behavior is defined as a message deducibility rule base governing use of eavesdropped information, with the aim to find out a message that is meant to be secret or to generate messages that impersonate some protocol participant(s). The advent of complex protocols like those used in e-commerce brings to the foreground intrusion attacks that are not always attributed to failures of secrecy or authentication. We introduce an intruder model that provides an open-ended base for the integration of multiple attack tactics. In our model checking approach, protocol correctness is checked by appropriate user-supplied assertions or reachability of invalid end states. Thus, the analyst can express e-commerce security guarantees that are not restricted to the absence of secrecy and the absence of authentication failures. The described intruder model was implemented within the SPIN model-checker and revealed an integrity violation attack on the PayWord micro payment protocol.</p>
