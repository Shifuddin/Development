                          <p class="Para">Denial-of-Service attacks are more prevalent than ever, despite the loss of media attention after the infamous attacks that shut down major Internet portals such as Yahoo, eBay and E*Trade in February 2000. In these flood-style denial-of-service attacks, attackers send specially formatted IP packets with forged or true IP source addresses at potentially high packet rates in order to overload/waste the resources of the routers or servers they are attacking. Determining the true sources of an attack stream, depending on the DDoS attack types, is a difficult problem given the nature of the IP protocol however it is often beneficial for the victims to acquire this information in a timely manner in order to stop the attack from further denying service to legitimate users. FRiTrace (Free ICMP Traceback) is an IP traceback implementation that can provide victims of flood-style denial-of-service attacks with sufficient information to determine the true sources of an attack, despite forged IP headers and varying attack architectures. In this paper, we present our design, implementation, and evaluation about FRiTrace.</p>
