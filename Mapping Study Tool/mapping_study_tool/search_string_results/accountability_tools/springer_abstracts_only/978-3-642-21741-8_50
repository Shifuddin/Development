                          <p class="Para">The objective of the reported work was to study the use and applicability of applied cognitive ergonomics design principles for fighter aircraft, with examples from the modern Swedish swing-role aircraft Gripen. Methods used were a literature review of relevant design principles together with an analysis of their applicability to the fighter aircraft domain as well as interviews of developers and scrutinized system documentation of ongoing fighter aircraft development at Saab. As a result of those activities, we can here present a brief description of cognitive ergonomics design principles applied in the Gripen fighter aircraft, and the development process for human-machine interaction for fighter aircraft. Finally, considerations for the design process for fighter aircraft are discussed in the context of that description.</p>
