                          <p class="Para">Modeling results from risk assessment and the selection of safeguards is an important activity in information security management. Many approaches for this activity focus on an organizational perspective, are embedded in heavyweight processes and tooling and require extensive preliminaries. We propose a lightweight approach introducing SeCoML – a readable language on top of an established methodology within an open framework. Utilizing standard tooling for creation, management and analysis of SeCoML models our approach supports security engineering and integrates well in different environments. Also, we report on early experiences of the language’s use.</p>
