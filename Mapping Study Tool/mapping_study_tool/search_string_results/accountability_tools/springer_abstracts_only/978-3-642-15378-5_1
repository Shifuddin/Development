                        <p class="Para">This paper reports on an investigation of the use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to aid in the teaching of students with learning disabilities. The term ’learning difficulties’ is used in reference to a heterogeneous group of students who are seen to have significant difficulties in the acquisition of literacy and numeracy skills. Other terms sometimes used in this context are ’learning disabilities’ and ’special needs’. The study involved participant observation of the use of ICT in two outer suburban Melbourne Special Schools, and an investigation of the role and impact of Education Department policies on these school environments. Research at the two Special Schools revealed that use of ICT can have a very beneficial impact on these students by improving their self esteem and facilitating their acquisition of useful life skills. The study was framed by the use of actor-network theory.</p>
