                          <p class="Para">The development of extranets is transforming enterprise networking. Rather than using proprietary networks to exchange private information, organisations can now set up corporate extranets to exchange data and share applications with strategic partners, suppliers, and customers in a global scale. Because extranets allow third-party users into corporate networks, they need to be extremely secure and external access needs to be highly controllable. Authorisation governs what an entity can do, thus it is a core element in network security. In this paper, we propose a new authorisation framework that can cope with the dynamic and outreaching characteristics of extranets. We apply the technique of one-shot authorisation token in providing extranet users with flexible direct access to applications without authenticating their identities every time. It also solves the problem of revocation and update of user privileges in off-line models. This authorisation scheme has various advantages in terms of higher efficiency and greater adaptability to the diverse application environment of extranets.</p>
