                          <p class="Para">A national infrastructure of Grid computing environments will provide access for a large pool of users to a large number of distributed computing resources. Providing access for the complete pool of potential users would put an unacceptably large administrative burden on sites that participate in the Grid. Current approaches to solve this problem require an account for each user at a site, or maps all users into one account. This paper proposes an alternative approach to account allocation that provides the benefits of persistent accounts while minimizing the administrative burden on Grid resource providers. A technique for calculating the upper bound on the number of jobs and users offered to the system from the Grid that is based on historical use is presented. Finally, application of this approach to the National Institutes of Health Visible Human Project is described.</p>
