                          <p class="Para">This chapter describes the protocols and the design of the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">SEMPER</em> Transfer and-Exchange Layer, in particular its generic and optimistic fair exchange protocols.</p>
                          <p class="Para">The basic problem which we solved is how to provide an open and extensible solution for exchanging two arbitrary business items fairly: Up to now, specialized fair exchange protocols were developed for any combination of two goods (examples include certified mail, contract signing, and fair-purchase protocols). This leads to a rapidly growing number of different exchange protocols if new kinds of business items are installed.</p>
