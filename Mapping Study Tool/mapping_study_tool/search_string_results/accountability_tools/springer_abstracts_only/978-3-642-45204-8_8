                        <p class="Para">This paper presents a formal approach for the analysis of privacy properties of complex electronic services. A flexible framework for logic reasoning allows for formally modeling these services in a typed first-order logic and for inferring privacy properties that can be interpreted by all the stakeholders including consumers. The inference strategy consists of compiling user profiles according to the expectations of the consumer about the data practices of the service providers involved. The data in these profiles originates from information that has been disclosed by the consumer during the service interactions or that may have been exchanged between organizations thereafter. The framework can infer relevant privacy properties from these profiles. To validate our work, the approach is applied to the modeling of a web shop.</p>
