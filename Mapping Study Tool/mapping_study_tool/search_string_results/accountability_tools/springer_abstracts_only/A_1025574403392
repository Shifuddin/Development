                          <p class="Para">This paper presents a state-of-the-art for billing from users' perspective, considering the development taking place in wireless technology. Further, authors propose a novel method for a ``Global Access Independent Billing Model'' for the success of present as well as future wireless communications services. The importance of billing for the success of any future wireless technology has to be placed at the sane level, if not higher, as that of defining application and services.</p>
