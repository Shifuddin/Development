                          <p class="Para">Networks today are dynamic (e.g. devices join and leave P2P communities or Bluetooth piconets) so programs need to be autonomous. This means that they must be able to continue working despite changes in the network. To provide autonomy, developers require a programming model where the communication primitives are non-blocking, where there is support for information lookup in a programâ€™s current network and where network outages are considered natural rather than as errors. This paper presents Lana, a programming model based on Java, that includes concepts for communication, mobility, security and connection recovery in order to support autonomy.</p>
