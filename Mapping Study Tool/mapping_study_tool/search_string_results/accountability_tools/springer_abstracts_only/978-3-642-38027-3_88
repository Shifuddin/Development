                          <p class="Para">Security vulnerabilities exist in end point devices such as PDAâ€™s, laptops, Blackberries, tablets, etc. Examples of endpoint software include anti spyware / malware software, encryption software, Data Loss Prevention system, Security USB and Device Control S/W, client operating system based firewalls, etc. It is important to note that leveraging company security policy and ensuring that it is enforced through stringent monitoring of in-house security breaches, further enhance the effectiveness of end point security. However, no criteria have been established as yet to evaluate whether such End point Security Software correctly provides the basic security functions needed by user and whether such functions have been securely developed. Therefore, this paper proposes security requirements of End point Security Software by modeling a threat and applying a security requirement engineering methodology based on Common Criteria.</p>
