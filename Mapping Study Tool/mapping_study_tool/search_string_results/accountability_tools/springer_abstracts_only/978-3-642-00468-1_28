                          <p class="Para">In this work, we consider the task of allowing a content provider to enforce complex access control policies on oblivious protocols conducted with anonymous users. As our primary application, we show how to construct privacy-preserving databases by combining oblivious transfer with an augmented anonymous credential system. This permits a database operator to restrict which items each user may access, without learning anything about users’ identities or item choices. This strong privacy guarantee holds even when users are assigned different access control policies and are allowed to adaptively make many queries. To do so, we show how to augment existing anonymous credential systems so that, in addition to certifying a user’s attributes, they also store state about the user’s database access history. Our construction supports a wide range of access control policies, including efficient and private realizations of the Brewer-Nash (Chinese Wall) and Bell-LaPadula (Multilevel Security) policies, which are used for financial and defense applications. In addition, our system is based on standard assumptions in the standard model and, after an initial setup phase, each transaction requires only constant time.</p>
