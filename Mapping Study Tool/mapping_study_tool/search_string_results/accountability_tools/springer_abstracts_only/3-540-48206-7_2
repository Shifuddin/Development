                          <p class="Para">Multimedia applications and IP networks are growing together. This paper proposes to introduce a modular, distributed and scalable Resource Control Layer as intermediary between the application and the network to deliver required quality of service guarantees. The function of the Resource Control Layer is to take care of resource management, resource offering and admission control. It is intended to be an add-on, which does neither affect the underlying network architectures nor the existing applications. Modern software engineering methods are exploited during the analysis, specification, implementation and trial phases. The proposal presented in this paper constitutes a major achievement of an ongoing three-year cooperation project, AQUILA, built by international specialists from providers, manufacturers and research institutes. This leads to practical applicability of the proposed approach to real networks.</p>
