                          <p class="Para">In this paper we describe a primitive, which we call, Certified Information Access, in which a database answers to a query by providing the information matching the query along with a proof that such information are consistent with the actual content of the database. We show that such a primitive can be securely implemented in a distributed fashion. Furthermore, we describe the design principles for a distributed architecture that would allow the use of this primitive on mobile devices.</p>
