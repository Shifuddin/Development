                          <p class="Para">Mandatory access control systems (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">MAC</em> ) are often criticised for their lack of flexibility, but they protect a system’s confidentiality from a wide range of untrustworthy Trojan Horse programs. On the other hand, discretionary access control systems (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DAC</em> ) place no restriction on flexibility. But, at present, they are generally regarded as inherently defenceless against all kinds of untrustworthy programs. We believe that this trade-off is not unavoidable. We show that, for lack of distinction between a user’s and a program’s trustworthiness, the vulnerability of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DAC</em> is design-based. On these grounds we present a modified (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DAC</em> ). The central idea is the separation of the management of rights from other activities of a user. The resulting system offers the flexibility of (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">DAC</em> ) and the protection of (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">MAC</em> ).</p>
