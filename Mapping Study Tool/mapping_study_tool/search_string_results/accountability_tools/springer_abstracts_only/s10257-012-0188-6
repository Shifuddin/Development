                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we discuss the critical issues with the implementation of electronic medical records and argue that the emerging e-services will not fully resolve the issues if they do not work together. To meet the challenge, we propose an integrated e-service model consisting of both process- and data-oriented grids that glue together distributed electronic medical services, records, and application services. We also provide an implementation architecture and prototype that validates the model.</p>
