                          <p class="Para">Concepts and principles of TINA (Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture) are introduced with the objective of correcting problems of the current centralized service control and service data model in an IN (Intelligent Network). It is becoming increasingly clear that the future sophisticated telecommunication services, e.g., multimedia, and multi-party conferencing, breaking away from the traditional telephony call model will need the solutions for rapid and efficient introduction, deployment, operations, and management.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we discuss accounting features and requirements, as well as security services in the TINA management context. We will introduce and present an implementation of a model for a security management, based on secure objects, cryptography and certificate distribution. In order to provide secure services, secure objects that have security functionality, such as authentication and access control, have been defined. Secure objects in our model are CORBA objects. The security domain is also called SBS (Security Base Server), provides security services and has an SMIB (Security Management Information Base) that contains security policies, cryptographic algorithms, and other relevant information. A prototype has been implemented and some experimental results are presented.</p>
