                          <p class="Para">With the development of satellite remote sensing technology, the volume of remote sensing image data grows exponentially, while the processing capability of common computer system is hard to satisfy the requirements of remote sensing image data accessing. In this paper, we propose a storage and search method Based on MapReduce mechanism in cloud computing environment, called BMR. It is a distributed and parallel storage method which combined with Pyramid Model and MapReduce Thinking. It recodes the tiles of each remote sensing image and defines the storage rule to ensure the tiles can be stored and searched in parallel. Experiments show that BMR method achieves good I/O performance.</p>
