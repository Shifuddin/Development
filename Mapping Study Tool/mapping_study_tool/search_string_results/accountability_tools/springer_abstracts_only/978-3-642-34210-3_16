                          <p class="Para">The Data Track is a transparency-enhancing tool that aims to educate users by providing them with an overview of all their data disclosures. In this paper, we describe a cryptographic scheme for storing all data disclosures tracked by the Data Track centrally in the cloud in a privacy-friendly way. Our scheme allows users to store their data anonymously, while keeping the cloud provider accountable with regard to the integrity of the data. Furthermore, we introduce a separation of concerns for the different components of the Data Track, well suited for tracking data disclosures from semi-trusted devices that may become compromised. We provide an informal evaluation of our scheme and briefly describe a proof of concept implementation.</p>
