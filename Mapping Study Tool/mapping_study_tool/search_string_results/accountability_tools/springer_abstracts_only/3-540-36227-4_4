                          <p class="Para">In light of the significant research activities in digital library, digital government, and e-commerce over the past decade, there seems to be common threads among them and unique challenges and opportunities ahead. For digital library, we are beginning to tally its research impacts and contemplate future directions. For digital government, information technologies could offer tremendous opportunities, but will they happen fast enough? We hope by discussing the many unique problems and challenges facing these fast evolving and somewhat related research disciplines, we could share lessons learned and develop insights for advancing our knowledge and achieving successful organizational transformation. A detailed case study of a research project (COPLINK) jointly funded by the NSF Digital Library and Digital Government Programs in the area of crime data mining will be presented in detail. We discuss how advanced visual crime mining techniques such as association rule mining, social network analysis, deception detection, temporal-spatial visualization, and agents could become the catalyst for assisting intelligence and law enforcement agencies in capturing knowledge and creating transformation.</p>
