                          <p class="Para">It is commonly observed that the continued exponential growth in the capacity of fundamental computing resources — processing power, communication bandwidth, and storage — is working a revolution in the capabilities and practices of the research community. It has become increasingly evident that the most revolutionary applications of this superabundance use <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">resource sharing</em> to enable new possibilities for collaboration and mutual benefit. Over the past 30 years, two basic models of resource sharing with different design goals have emerged. The differences between these two approaches, which we distinguish as the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Computer Center</em> and the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Internet</em> models, tend to generate divergent opportunity spaces, and it therefore becomes important to explore the alternative choices they present as we plan for and develop an information infrastructure for the scientific community in the next decade.</p>
