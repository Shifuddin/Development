                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we propose a framework for supporting socially-compatible privacy objectives in ubiquitous computing settings. Drawing on social science research, we have developed a key objective called the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Principle of Minimum Asymmetry</em>, which seeks to minimize the imbalance between the people about whom data is being collected, and the systems and people that collect and use that data. We have also developed <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Approximate Information Flow</em> (AIF), a model describing the interaction between the various actors and personal data. AIF effectively supports varying degrees of asymmetry for ubicomp systems, suggests new privacy protection mechanisms, and provides a foundation for inspecting privacy-friendliness of ubicomp systems.</p>
