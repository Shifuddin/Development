                          <p class="Para">This paper is about the development and use of an ontology of e-government services. We identify the knowledge required to deliver e-government transaction services. Based on the SmartGov project, we describe the use of a domain map to assist in knowledge management and motivate the use of an ontology as a domain map. We describe the development of the e-government service ontology and give a few examples of its definitions. We explain why the SmartGov project has adopted taxonomies, derived from the ontology, as its domain map. We highlight issues in ontology development and maintenance.</p>
