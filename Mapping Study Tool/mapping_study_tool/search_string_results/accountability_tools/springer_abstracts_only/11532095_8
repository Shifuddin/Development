                        <p class="Para">We present an analysis Trust Analysis Methodology for finding trust issues within pervasive computing systems. It is based on a systematic analysis of scenarios that describe the typical use of the pervasive system by using a Trust Analysis Grid. The Trust Analysis Grid is composed of eleven Trust Issue Categories that cover the various aspects of the concept of trust in pervasive computing systems. The Trust Analysis Grid is then used to guide the design of the pervasive computing system.</p>
