                          <p class="Para">The increasing number of linkable vendor-operated databases present unique threats to customer privacy and security intrusions, as personal information communicated in online transactions can be misused by the vendor. Existing privacy enhancing technologies fail in the event of a vendor operating against their stated privacy policy, leading to loss of customer privacy and security. Anonymity may not be applicable when transactions require identification of participants. We propose a service-oriented technically enforceable system that preserves privacy and security for customers transacting with untrusted online vendors. The system extends to support protection of customer privacy when multiple vendors interact in composite web services. A <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">semi-trusted processor</em> is introduced for safe execution of sensitive customer information in a protected environment and provides accountability in the case of disputed transactions.</p>
