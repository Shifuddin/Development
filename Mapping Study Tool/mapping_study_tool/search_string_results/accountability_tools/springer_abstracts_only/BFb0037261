                        <p class="Para">Establishing a healthcare society for the 21<sup>st</sup> century is becoming a global grand challenge. Computing networks, such as the Internet and World Wide Web, and telemedical applications, such as remote teleconsultations form the foundations on which a 21<sup>st</sup> century telemedical information society can be created. Supported by the European Commission, a consortium of partners from academia, industry and the health care sector have embarked on two research projects to develop the fundamentals of secure telemedicine networks. The goal of the EC ISIS '95 EUROMED project is to enhance and standardize visualization techniques combined with the use of WWW for telemedicine applications throughout Europe, the EC INFOSEC EUROMED-ETS project aims to secure these telemedicine applications by establishing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Trusted Third Party Services over secure Web</em>. In this paper we will concentrate on the security solution applied during EUROMED-ETS.</p>
