                            <p class="Para">E-Government, today, is being regarded as the panacea for many of the conventional government ills, such as rampant corruption in developing countries to costly service deliveries in the developed countries.

The fundamental strength of this model lies in the fact that it has acknowledged the society as a foundation pillar in the e-government model and the entire economy progresses with the coalescence of all four parties included.</p>
