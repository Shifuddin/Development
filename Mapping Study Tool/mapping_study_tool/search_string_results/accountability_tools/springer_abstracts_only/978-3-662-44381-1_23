                          <p class="Para">A recent line of work has explored the use of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">physically uncloneable functions (PUFs)</em> for secure computation, with the goals of (1)&nbsp;achieving universal composability without (additional) setup, and/or (2)&nbsp;obtaining unconditional security (i.e., avoiding complexity-theoretic assumptions). Initial work assumed that all PUFs, even those created by an attacker, are honestly generated. Subsequently, researchers have investigated models in which an adversary can create <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">malicious</em> PUFs with arbitrary behavior. Researchers have considered both malicious PUFs that might be stateful, as well as malicious PUFs that can have arbitrary behavior but are guaranteed to be stateless.</p>
                                <p class="Para">We prove that unconditionally secure oblivious transfer is impossible, even in the stand-alone setting, if the adversary can construct (malicious) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">stateful</em> PUFs.</p>
                                <p class="Para">We show that universally composable two-party computation is possible if the attacker is limited to creating (malicious) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">stateless</em> PUFs. Our protocols are simple and efficient, and do not require any cryptographic assumptions.</p>
