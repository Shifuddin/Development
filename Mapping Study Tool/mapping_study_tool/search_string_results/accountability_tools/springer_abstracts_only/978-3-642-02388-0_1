                          <p class="Para">The work in this volume examines the real-world confluence of several concepts that are too often studied in isolation from each other. Research into creativity too rarely considers the presumed ability of smaller organisations to contribute a large proportion of the innovations introduced into the practical information systems field. There is also far too little research that addresses the notion that smaller organisations more intelligently manage their creativity and innovation, not only in the organisational signal products, but also in structures and processes found in smaller organisations.</p>
