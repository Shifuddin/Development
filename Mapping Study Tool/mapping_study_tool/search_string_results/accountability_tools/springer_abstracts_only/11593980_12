                        <p class="Para">Recent paradigms like “database as a service” require an additional infrastructure to guarantee data security. Data protection laws such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, Data protection Act, Sarbanes Oxleys Act are demanding for the data security to an extent that the critical information should be seen only by the authorized users which means the integrity and confidentiality of the database must be properly accommodated. Hence we aim at building up a wrapper/interface in between encrypted database server and applications that ensures the data privacy and integrity. Specifically, we worked on querying over encrypted databases and our approach produces query results on encrypted data with no false hits and hence reduces the network consumption between applications and encrypted server.</p>
