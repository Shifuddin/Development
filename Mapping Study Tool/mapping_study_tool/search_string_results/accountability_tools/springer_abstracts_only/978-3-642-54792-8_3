                          <p class="Para">Dolev-Yao models of cryptographic operations constitute the foundation of many successful verification tools for security protocols, such as the protocol verifier ProVerif. Research over the past decade has shown that many of these symbolic abstractions are computationally sound, i.e., the absence of attacks against the abstraction entails the security of suitable cryptographic realizations. Most of these computational soundness (CS) results, however, are restricted to trace properties such as authentication, and the few promising results that strive for CS for the more comprehensive class of equivalence properties, such as strong secrecy or anonymity, either only consider a limited class of protocols or are not amenable to fully automated verification.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In this work, we identify a general condition under which CS for trace properties implies CS for uniformity of bi-processes, i.e., the class of equivalence properties that ProVerif is able to verify for the applied <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>-calculus. As a case study, we show that this general condition holds for a Dolev-Yao model that contains signatures, public-key encryption, and corresponding length functions. We prove this result in the CoSP framework (a general framework for establishing CS results). To this end, we extend the CoSP framework to equivalence properties, and we show that an existing embedding of the applied <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>-calculus to CoSP can be re-used for uniform bi-processes. On the verification side, as analyses in ProVerif with symbolic length functions often do not terminate, we show how to combine the recent protocol verifier APTE with ProVerif. As a result, we establish a computationally sound automated verification chain for uniformity of bi-processes in the applied <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">π</em>-calculus that use public-key encryption, signatures, and length functions.</p>
