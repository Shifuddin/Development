                          <p class="Para">Challenges for incorporating “quality in use” in embedded system development were discussed. In the Japanese embedded system industries the foundation of the quality in use management is not necessarily established because of their various backgrounds and histories. In the paper three key points to introduce the quality in use into the design process in the industries were proposed. These were implementation of user requirement process, understanding of “service” as final outcome and synchronization to functional safety.</p>
