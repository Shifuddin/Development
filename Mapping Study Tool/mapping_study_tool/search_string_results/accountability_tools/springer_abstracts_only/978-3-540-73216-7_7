                          <p class="Para">This paper takes an interdisciplinary look at how the electronic record is likely to evolve in the future. From what new sources will data be drawn? Will such data be directly recorded from sensory devices and from one’s personal “memex”? Will these data enable a new set of outputs to more fully interconnect patients with their health care system. The paper considers the combined impact of a host of emerging technologies:</p>
                                  <p class="Para">the impact of the networking phenomenon</p>
                                  <p class="Para">the impact of adding robust patient access to the EMR</p>
                                  <p class="Para">the impact of the growing emergence of PHRs</p>
                                  <p class="Para">the impact of emerging technologies on the usability of the EMR</p>
                                  <p class="Para">the impact of direct sensory input devices</p>
                                  <p class="Para">the impact of bioinformatics and genomics</p>
                                  <p class="Para">the impact of the personal memex</p>
