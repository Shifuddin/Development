                          <p class="Para">Community-based healthcare information systems (HIS) are developed to cope with the demand for home healthcare. However, the issue of privacy protection in HIS adoption has not been given sufficient attention. This study is to propose a privacy‐enhanced framework and to investigate the role of privacy protection in HIS adoption. Our research model extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology by considering perceived security and information security literacy. Our experimental HIS is implemented according to our proposed privacy‐enhanced framework which integrates healthcare applications and privacy protection mechanisms. The former includes health management, physiological monitoring, healthcare education, and healthcare consulting modules. The latter contains secure transmission, privacy protection and access control modules. Analyses indicate that user adoption of HIS is directly affected by social influence, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and perceived security. Perceived security has a mediating effect between information security literacy and user adoption.</p>
