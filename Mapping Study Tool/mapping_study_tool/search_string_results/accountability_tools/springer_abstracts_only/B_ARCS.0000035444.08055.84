                          <p class="Para">The paper focuses on the convergence of Finnishresearch and education in archival science withinformation science in general and in recordsmanagement with information management inparticular. Two issues influencing thisdevelopment are: the convergence ofprofessionals previously worked in the archivaland library sectors and in informationmanagement and services; and the wide-spread,extensive growth in the use of digitaltechnology to manage internal and externalorganizational information. At the level ofsociety the opportunities provided by digitaltechnology to manage heritage information inmemory organizations like archives,libraries and museums, are tremendous and therole of documentary heritage at the global,European and national levels is wellrecognized. These developments are changing the information and operating environments ofmemory organizations and public and privateenterprises. These changes, in turn, aregenerating new requirements in archival scienceand records management education and research.This paper focuses on the implications of thesechanges for the planning, implementation andfurther development of an information studiescurriculum. This curriculum development isconsidered crucial in order to respond to thenew demands, and is also implicitly linked tothe emerging Finnish information society.</p>
