                          <p class="Para">Ticket-switching incidents where customers switch the price tag or bar code in order to pay a lower amount for their ‘purchased item’ is not uncommon in retail stores. Since the item has to pass through a check-out counter before leaving the store, it has a (even if miniscule) positive probability of being identified. However, when item-level RFID tags are used in an automated check-out environment, the probability of such incidents coming to light is estimated to be almost zero. We propose an authentication protocol for this scenario using a pair of item-level RFID tags, one of which is PUF-enabled to resist cloning attacks.</p>
