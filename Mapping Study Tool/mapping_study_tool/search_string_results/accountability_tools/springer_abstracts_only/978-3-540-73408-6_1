                        <p class="Para">Even more than in our physical world, in our digital world we need systems that meet the security objective of service providers and users in equal measure. This paper investigates the requirements of secure authorizations with respect to accountability and privacy in the context of surveillance for misuse detection during service utilization. We develop a model of system architectures for secure and privacy-respecting authorizations that allows to derive and compare the properties of available technology. It is shown how the model maps to existing authorization architectures.</p>
