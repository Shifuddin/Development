                          <p class="Para">This paper introduces a universal data access (DA) server for modern distributed data acquisition and monitoring systems used in process and factory automation. This system is proposed with utilization of the OPC (Openness, Productivity, and Collaboration) technology and XML to achieving interoperability and platform independence. It allows to easily aggregate a large number of existing OPC DA servers and new OPC XML-DA servers into a unified and flexible system that supports exchange of data among these servers. By using binary data encoding to the SOAP messages, the proposed system has a sufficient good performance. The security consideration is discussed to provide more information to technical-level readers. The comparison of the proposed system with the existing approaches is also presented.</p>
