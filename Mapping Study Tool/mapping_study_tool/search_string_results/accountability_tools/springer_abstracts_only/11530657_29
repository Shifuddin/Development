                          <p class="Para">This chapter focuses on the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">economic</em> aspects of Peer-to-Peer networks. In particular, it describes the most important requirements and presents a basic architecture for a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">market-managed</em> Peer-to-Peer system supporting commercial applications going beyond pure file sharing. In general Peer-to-Peer systems can be used to share <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">any</em> kind of resource, including but not limited to, computing power, storage space, network capacity, files, and any combination thereof, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">e.g.</em>, online games or multimedia streams. In the following, the term <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">service</em> will be used to refer to the individual provision of goods or resources by peers. The main goal is a completely decentralized and generic marketplace for efficient trading of such services among peers.</p>
