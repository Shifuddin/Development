                          <p class="Para">This paper contributes to research on the success and failure of information and communication technologies (ICT) by focusing on the learning processes associated with the development of new ICT projects and the way they challenge and extend familiar organizational limits. Drawing on recent developments in activity theory, we provide an analysis of oral and written evidence taken before a House of Commons Committee in relation to the UKâ€™s National Program for IT (NPfIT). Our preliminary findings point to the ways in which new objects of activity such as the NPfIT can emerge from the meeting of contrasting forms of discursive activity, as well as how new policy insights can be translated into new organizational practices. We conclude with some implications for further research.</p>
