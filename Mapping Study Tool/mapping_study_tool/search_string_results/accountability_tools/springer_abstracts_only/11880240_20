                          <p class="Para">The <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">Sectet</span>-framework realizes an extensible domain architecture for the collaborative development and management of security-critical, inter-organizational workflows. Models integrate security requirements at the abstract level and are rendered in a visual language based on UML 2.0. The models form the input for a chain of integrated tools that transform them into artefacts configuring security components of a Web services-based architecture. Based on findings of various projects, this contribution has three objectives. First, we detail the MOF based metamodels defining a domain specific language for the design of inter-organizational workflows. The language supports various categories of security patterns. We then specify model-to-model transformations based on the MDA standard MOF-QVT. The mappings translate platform independent models into platform specific artefacts targeting the reference architecture. Third, we exemplarily show how model-to-code transformation could be implemented with an MDA-framework like <span class="EmphasisTypeSmallCaps ">openArchitectureWare</span>.</p>
