                        <p class="Para">Mobile agent systems provide new perspectives for distributed e-commerce applications. These applications may present specific restrictions, making mobile agent systems a feasible solution. Even so, mobile agents present some security related problems. An important one is resource access control. The ability for mobile agents to provide a simple, scalable, flexible, and secure access control system is a key point for the widespread adoption of mobile agents. In this paper we propose a mechanism to safely assign roles to mobile agents and an access control method based on <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Role-based Access Control</em> (RBAC). The access control method provides a simple, lightweight and distributed model for mobile agent applications. It is proposed as an extension of the MARISM-A (<em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">An Architecture for Mobile Agents with Recursive Itineraries and Secure Migration</em>) project, a secure mobile agent platform.</p>
