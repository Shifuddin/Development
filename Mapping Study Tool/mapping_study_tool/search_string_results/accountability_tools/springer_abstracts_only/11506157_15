                          <p class="Para">In this paper we introduce a new infrastructural approach to providing mobile agent execution integrity, a very important property – especially to the confidence an agent user can place in the results of its deployed autonomous mobile agents. Existing mobile agent execution integrity schemes are shown to be comparatively inferior when analysed in light of a number of essential robustness properties. We provide an analysis of Hohl’s reference states scheme and introduce our novel execution integrity scheme, which builds – in part – on Hohl’s scheme. Besides significantly improving on this existing scheme, our scheme meets all of the desired criteria for a robust execution integrity scheme.</p>
