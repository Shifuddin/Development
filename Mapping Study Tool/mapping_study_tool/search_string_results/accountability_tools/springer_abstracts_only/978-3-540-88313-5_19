                          <p class="Para">Automated trust negotiation (ATN) is a promising approach to establishing trust between two entities without any prior knowledge of each other. However, real-world authorization processes often involve online input from third parties, which ATN does not support. In this paper, we introduce <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">multiparty trust negotiation</em> (MTN) as a new approach to distributed authorization. We define a Datalog-based policy language, Distributed Authorization and Release Control Logic (DARCL), to specify both authorization and release control policies. DARCL suits the needs of MTN and can also serve as a powerful general-purpose policy language for authorization. To orchestrate the negotiation process among multiple parties without a centralized moderator, we propose the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">diffusion negotiation protocol</em>, a set of message-passing conventions that allows parties to carry out a negotiation in a distributed fashion. Building on top of the diffusion negotiation protocol, we propose two negotiation strategies, both safe and complete, to drive MTN with different tradeoffs between privacy and negotiation speed.</p>
