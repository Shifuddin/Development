                          <p class="Para">SOA, Service Oriented Architecture, some people tightly couple this concept with some technologies, as some believes that SOA is about Web Services and its orchestrations. SOA, is the umbrella of “Business Services” and “Enterprise Architecture”, meanwhile the technology evolves in the direction of building and sustaining both concepts; at early days it was tight to Enterprise Application Integration and vendor specific solutions, then Web Services and its orchestrations, and now Business Process Management is in the front with the WS-BPEL, WfMC-XPDL, ebXML-BP business integration open standards. However, Open Standards communities have helped a lot in understanding SOA concepts and building the base open standards for implementing SOA in right approaches, it is not providing an open solution implementation framework for SOA. This article proposes an Open Solution Business Process Integration and Management Implementation Framework based on technology open standards that we believe in its value for today and future. By this initiative article we are looking for examining and verifying this framework through SOA communities.</p>
