                          <p class="Para">Today, the management of information resources in the Internet is mostly realized by centralized services. Clients can contact the server and access these resources. Nevertheless, the classic client-server architecture suffers from some limitations caused by holding every data in one central place.</p>
                          <p class="Para">Internet communities are groups of individuals sharing a common interest or work scope. The connection between the members of a community creates a logical structure overlying the physical network structure. The community structure can be adapted and modified. This allows the appliance of some efficient and innovative algorithms and techniques. This is realized in the AWeb information management system.</p>
                          <p class="Para">In the contribution, a decentralized library for scientific articles based on the AWeb middelware is presented and the main concepts of the AWeb will be summarized in brief.</p>
