                          <p class="Para">The number of mobile applications in mobile market has rapidly increased as new technology and new devices are emerging at remarkable speed which shows mobile applications have an important role in every field of our life. Among those, even some of the mobile applications have a long time life as end-users use those effectively, some of them fail to do so that prevents the companies to reach from their aim. The main reason of that problem results from the quality of the mobile applications. Although there are some methods and metrics to analyze the quality of mobile applications, they have lack of criteria since they are mostly based on ISO 9126 quality model factors which are invalid anymore. This study aims to analyze both mobile commerce applicationsâ€™ characteristics and quality factors and sub-factors based on ISO 25010 product quality model. Accordingly a quality model is proposed by analysis performed by a group of experts from the mobile software development area. The results of this study aims to help developing more qualified and effective mobile applications from developer perspective.</p>
