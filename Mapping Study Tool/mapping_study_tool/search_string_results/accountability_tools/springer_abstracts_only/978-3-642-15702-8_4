                          <p class="Para">This study proposes a strategy for determining the approximate geographical location of a webcam based on a sequence of images taken at regular intervals. For a time-stamped image sequence spanning 24 hours the approximate sunrise and sunset times are determined by classifying images into day and nighttime images based on the image intensity. Based on the sunrise and sunset times both the latitude and longitude of the webcam can be determined. Experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategy.</p>
