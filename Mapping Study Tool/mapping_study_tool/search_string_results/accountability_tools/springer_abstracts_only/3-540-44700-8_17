                          <p class="Para">In this paper, based on CORBA security service specification[<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3">3</a></span>], we propose the authentication model supporting multiple domains for electronic commerce with an extension to the Kerberos[<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13">13</a></span>] authentication framework using public key cryptosystem[<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15">15</a></span>]. This proposed model supports the protection of the high-level resources and the preservation of the security policies of the underlying resources that form the foundation of various domains, between the Kerberized domains[<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14">14</a></span>] and the Non-Kerberized domains. Also we achieved the flexibility of key management and reliable session key generation between the Client and the Provider using the public key cryptosystem.</p>
