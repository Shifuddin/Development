                          <p class="Para">Trusted Computing is a security technology which enables the establishment of trust between multiple parties. Previous work showed that Trusted Computing technology can be used to build tickets, a core concept of Identity Management Systems. Relying solely on the Trusted Platform Module we will demonstrate how this technology can be used in the context of Kerberos for an implementation variant of Identity Management.</p>
