                          <p class="Para">In vehicular ad hoc networks, vehicles may be tracked due to the frequent sending of beacons containing telemetic data. Even changing the vehicleâ€™s pseudonym cannot prevent attackers from linking beacons. Previously published solutions require vehicles to stop sending beacons when changing their pseudonyms, resulting in the loss of safety. We propose a novel concept based on the approach of mix zones, providing a compromise between privacy and safety. Therefore we introduce a communication proxy inside the mix zones. Simulations show that this approach is technically feasible, even with common hardware.</p>
