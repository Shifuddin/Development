                          <p class="Para">Structured peer-to-peer (p2p) overlay networks provide a decentralized, self-organizing substrate for distributed applications and support powerful abstractions such as distributed hash tables (DHTs) and group communication. However, in most of these systems, lack of control over key placement and routing paths raises concerns over autonomy, administrative control and accountability of participating organizations. Additionally, structured p2p overlays tend to assume global connectivity while in reality, network address translation and firewalls limit connectivity among hosts in different organizations. In this paper, we present a general technique that ensures content/path locality and administrative autonomy for participating organizations, and provides natural support for NATs and firewalls. Instances of conventional structured overlays are configured to form a hierarchy of identifier spaces that reflects administrative boundaries and respects connectivity constraints among networks.</p>
