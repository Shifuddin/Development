                          <p class="Para">We introduce <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ad hoc</em> Anonymous Identification schemes, a new multi-user cryptographic primitive that allows participants from a user population to form <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">ad-hoc</em> groups, and then prove membership anonymously in such groups. Our schemes are based on the notion of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">accumulator with one-way domain</em>, a natural extension of cryptographic accumulators we introduce in this work. We provide a formal model for <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Ad hoc</em> Anonymous Identification schemes and design secure such schemes both generically (based on any accumulator with one-way domain) and for a specific efficient implementation of such an accumulator based on the Strong RSA Assumption. A salient feature of our approach is that all the identification protocols take time independent of the size of the ad-hoc group. All our schemes and notions can be generally and efficiently amended so that they allow the recovery of the signerâ€™s identity by an authority, if the latter is desired.</p>
                          <p class="Para">Using the Fiat-Shamir transform, we also obtain <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">constant-size</em>, signer-ambiguous group and ring signatures (provably secure in the Random Oracle Model). For ring signatures, this is the first such constant-size scheme, as all the previous proposals had signature size proportional to the size of the ring. For group signatures, we obtain schemes comparable in performance with state-of-the-art schemes, with the additional feature that the role of the group manager during key registration is extremely simple and essentially passive: all it does is accept the public key of the new member (and update the constant-size public key of the group).</p>
