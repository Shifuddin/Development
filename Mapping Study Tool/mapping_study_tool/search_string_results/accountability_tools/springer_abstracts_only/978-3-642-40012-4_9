                          <p class="Para">The goal of GeoPKI is to enable secure certificate validation (without user interaction) for situations in which a user interacts with an online entity associated with the physical space where the the user trusts (and usually is currently located). GeoPKI enables the owner of a space to associate a certificate with that space, and enables space-based certificate lookup to set up a secure channel to the online resource associated with the space. Such a system enables several secure applications, such as secure authentication of paywall certificates at an airport or hotel.</p>
