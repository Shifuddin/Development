                          <p class="Para">In this paper the acceptance of a sensor-based Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) application is investigated. To get an insight into the users’ perception and needs, three fictive use scenarios were created that illustrated the potential features of the technology. Consequently, the scenarios were presented to primary (i.e., older adults) and secondary (i.e., formal and informal caregivers) user groups. Through focus groups and semi-structured interviews in France, UK and Belgium, fourteen design implications could be identified based on the preliminary analyses of the users’ feedback. These implications will direct the future testing and development of the conceptual technology and can be meaningful to related AAL applications.</p>
