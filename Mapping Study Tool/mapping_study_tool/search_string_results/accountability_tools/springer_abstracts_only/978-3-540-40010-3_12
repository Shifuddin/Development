                          <p class="Para">IT enforced access control policies in medical information systems have to be fine-grained and dynamic. We justify this observation on the basis of legislation and on the basis of the evolution within the healthcare domain. Consequently, a reconfigurable or at least adaptable implementation of access control facilities has become extremely important. For this purpose, current technology provides insufficient support. We highlight a basic solution to address shortcomings by using interception techniques. In addition, we identify further research that is required to address the challenges of dynamic and fine-grained access control in the long run.</p>
