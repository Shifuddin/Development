                          <p class="Para">Compliance policies often stipulate conditions on aggregated data. Current policy monitoring approaches are limited in the kind of aggregations that they can handle. We rectify this as follows. First, we extend metric first-order temporal logic with aggregation operators. This extension is inspired by the aggregation operators common in database query languages like SQL. Second, we provide a monitoring algorithm for this enriched policy specification language. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our monitorâ€™s performance.</p>
