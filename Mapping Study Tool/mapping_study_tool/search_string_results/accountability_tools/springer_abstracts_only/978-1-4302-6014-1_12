                      <p class="Para">In this chapter, we present a summary of the subject matter covered in previous chapters. We revisit the key influences that currently drive the development of sensor-based applications in the health, wellness and health-related environmental monitoring. We also look toward the future of sensing by examining some emerging trends, including those that suggest how pervasive sensors will become in many aspects of our daily lives. We discuss how the evolution of technology brought pervasive connectivity and computing, and how it will impact future sensor applications. We also examine how crowdsourcing empowers citizens, adding an innovative element to future sensor applications. Finally, we explore the sensing nexus that stems from the way sensors interconnect with information and communications technologies. New and innovative sensing solutions will enable us to develop fresh insights at a personalized level into how our behaviors, lifestyle choices, and other factors influence our health and wellbeing.</p>
