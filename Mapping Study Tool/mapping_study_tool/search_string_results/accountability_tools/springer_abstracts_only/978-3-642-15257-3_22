                          <p class="Para">Privacy in cloud computing is at the moment simply a promise to be kept by the software service providers. Users are neither able to control the disclosure of personal data to third parties nor to check if the software service providers have followed the agreed-upon privacy policy. Therefore, disclosure of the usersâ€˜ data to the software service providers of the cloud raises privacy risks. In this article, we show a privacy risk by the example of using electronic health records abroad. As a countermeasure by an ex post enforcement of privacy policies, we propose to observe disclosures of personal data to third parties by using data provenance history and digital watermarking.</p>
