                      <p class="Para">In the last few chapters we covered the technologies, usage models, and capabilities that are required to enable trusted infrastructure in the cloudâ€“one of the foundation pillars for trusted clouds. We looked at the concepts, solution architectures, and ISV components that establish and propagate platform trust, attestation, and boundary control, all of which are required to enable the trusted clouds. The other foundational pillar to enable them is identity management, and that is the focus on this chapter.</p>
