                        <p class="Para">Thanks to its low product-promotion cost and its efficiency, targeted online advertising has become very popular. Unfortunately, being profile-based, online advertising methods violate consumers’ privacy, which has engendered resistance to the ads. However, protecting privacy through anonymity seems to encourage click-fraud. In this paper, we define consumer’s privacy and present a privacy-preserving, targeted ad system (<span class="EmphasisFontCategorySansSerif ">PPOAd)</span> which is resistant towards click fraud. Our scheme is structured to provide financial incentives to all entities involved.</p>
