                          <p class="Para">We are witnessing the emergence of a global infrastructure that enables the widespread deployment of geo-enabled, mobile services in practice. At the same time, the research community has also paid increasing attention to data management aspects of mobile services. This paper offers me an opportunity to characterize this research area and to describe some of their challenges and pitfalls, and it affords me an opportunity to look back and reflect upon some of the general challenges we face as researchers. I hope that my views and experiences as expressed in this paper may enable others to challenge their own views about this exciting research area and about how to best carry out their research in their own unique contexts.</p>
