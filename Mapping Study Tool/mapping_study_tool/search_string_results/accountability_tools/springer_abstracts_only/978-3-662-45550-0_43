                          <p class="Para">Software systems start small and grow in complexity and size. The larger a software system is, the more it is distributed over organizational and geographical confines. Thus, the modeling of software systems is necessary at a certain level of complexity because it can be used for communication, documentation, configuration and certification purposes. We came to the conclusion that several patterns of software modeling exist. The existence of such patterns is dependent on the history and the evolution of the system under consideration. We will show that a software system in its lifecycle has to face several crises. Such a crisis is a watershed in the application of new patterns. We provide an evolutionary view of software systems and models which helps understanding of current problems and prospective solutions.</p>
