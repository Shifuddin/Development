                          <p class="Para">Corporations are using computational GRIDs to improve their operations. Future GRIDs will allow an organisation to take advantage of computational GRIDs without having to develop a custom in-house solution. GRID Resource Providers (GRP) make resources available on the GRID so that others may use these resources. GRPs allow companies to make use of a range of resources such as processing power or mass storage. However simply providing resources is not enough to ensure the success of a computational GRID. Access to these resources must be controlled otherwise computational GRIDs will simply evolve to become a victim of their own success, unable to offer a suitable Quality of Service (QoS) to any user. The task of providing a standard querying mechanism for Computational GRID Environments (CGE) has already witnessed considerable work from groups such as the Globus project who have delivered the Metacomputing Directory Service (MDS) which provides a means to query devices attached to the GRID. This paper describes a monitoring component both capable of the dynamic discovery of available resources in a computing GRID environment and executing user jobs on the available resource at a given moment in time. Consideration has been paid to integrating with GRID accounting systems.</p>
