                          <p class="Para">Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is to interaction between computers and each person. And context-aware (CA) is very important one of HCI composition. In particular, if there are sequential or continuous tasks between users and devices, among users, and among devices etc, it is important to decide the next action using right CA. And to take perfect decision we have to get together all CA into a structure. We define that structure is Context-Aware Matrix (CAM) in this article. However to make exact decision is too hard for some problems like low accuracy, overhead and bad context by attacker etc. Many researcher has been studying to solve these problems. Moreover, still it has weak point HCI using in safety. In this Article, we propose CAM making include best selecting Server in each area. As a result, moving users could be taken the best way.</p>
