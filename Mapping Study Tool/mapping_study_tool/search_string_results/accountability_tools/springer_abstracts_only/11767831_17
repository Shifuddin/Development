                        <p class="Para">In an online world, the temptation to exploit customer information for marketing purposes is a strong argument for customers to use a privacy enhancing identity management system.

Apart from practical aspects, such as usability, trustworthiness, and standardisation, economic aspects play a key role in this decision. This paper examines the cost-utility trade-off from a supply-side perspective with micro-economic models. Albeit still limited to the case of a monopolist supplier, we reflect the impact of different customer preferences towards privacy, and the possibility to implement price discrimination.</p>
