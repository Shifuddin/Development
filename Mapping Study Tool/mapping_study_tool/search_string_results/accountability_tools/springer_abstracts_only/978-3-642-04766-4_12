                          <p class="Para">We address inhibiting factors of mobile real-time services. Since research provides evidence that perceived risk is one major inhibiting factor for the adoption of mobile services, we explore current approaches that should safeguard existing security requirements. First, we develop a classification scheme of mobile real-time applications. We then empirically explore practical and security requirements for the different service classes. Our analysis indicates that current implementation concepts do not meet existent service requirements. Therefore, we present an alternative approach on the basis of SIM-based security tokens. The additional functionalities provided by these tokens can overcome functional or security constraints of existing implementations.</p>
