                            <p class="Para">Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is a catalyst to enhance the level of community empowerment – with this motivation, this paper reports on a research study on “Community Empowerment Through ICTs: Evidence from Grassroots in Bangladesh and India”. The evidence from an early benchmark study from Bangladesh shows that ICT penetration on its own is not proportionately related with community empowerment. Rather, ICT penetration with a precise application of ICT governance, strengthens community empowerment. The evidence also shows that if ICT penetration is high, but ICT governance is low, ICT does not remain as high a catalytic factor for community empowerment.</p>
