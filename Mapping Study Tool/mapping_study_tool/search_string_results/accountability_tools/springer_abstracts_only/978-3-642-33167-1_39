                          <p class="Para">Anonymous authentication schemes allow users to act freely without being tracked. The users may not want to trust a third party in ensuring their privacy, yet a service provider (SP) should have the authority to blacklist a misbehaving user. They are seemingly contradicting requirements. PEREA was the most efficient solution to this problem. However, there are a few drawbacks which make it vulnerable and not practical enough. In this paper, we propose PE(AR)<sup>2</sup>, which not only fixes PEREA’s vulnerability, but also significantly improves its computation efficiency. Apart from revoking repeated misbehaving users, our system also rewards anonymous users via a built-in reputation system. Our scheme does not require the SP to timely review all previously authenticated sessions, and does not have the dependency on the blacklist size for user-side computation (c.f. EPID/BLAC(R)). Our benchmark on PE(AR)<sup>2</sup> shows that an SP can handle over 160 requests/second – a 460-fold efficiency improvement over PEREA, when the credentials store 1000 single-use tickets.</p>
