                          <p class="Para">Manufacturers require an efficient reaction to critical events occurring at the process plants. Device data need to be integrated into business processes in a standardized and flexible way. Current research is limited due to a late indication of changes in the production environments, a delay of the implementation of changed production plans, and changes in technology. In this study, design issues arising from features of Internet-based monitoring and control applications have been addressed and an approach based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the OPC (Openness, Productivity, and Collaboration; formerly “OLE for Process Control”) technology for such applications is proposed by integrating the enterprise systems with shop floor activities. Remote operators use the proposed system that collects all data from distributed control systems (DCSs) or programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to control complex manufacturing processes. Complex processes, i.e., process control and monitoring functions, will be spanned from devices on the shop floors to enterprise systems. Security of remote invocations in the heterogeneous environments is also ensured. The simulation results indicate the proposed system has good performance and is acceptable to Internet-based monitoring and control applications.</p>
