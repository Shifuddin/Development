                          <p class="Para">A PP (protection profile) defines an implementation-independent set of security requirements for a category of Target of Evaluations. Consumers or owners can therefore construct or cite a PP to express their security needs without reference to any specific IT products. Generally, PP contains security assurance requirements about the security of development environment for IT product or system and PP can applied to ubiquitous software development site. This paper proposes some security environments for ubiquitous software development site by analyzing the ALC_DVS.1 of the ISO/IEC 15408 and Base Practices (BPs) of the ISO/IEC 21827.</p>
