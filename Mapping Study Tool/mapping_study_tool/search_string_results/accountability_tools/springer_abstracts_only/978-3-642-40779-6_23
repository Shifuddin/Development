                          <p class="Para">This paper presents an overview on how existing development methodologies and practices support the creation of trustworthy software. Trustworthy software is key for a successful and trusted usage of software, specifically in the Cloud. To better understand what trustworthy software applications actually mean, the concepts of trustworthiness and trust are defined and put in contrast to each other. Furthermore, we identify attributes of software applications that support trustworthiness. Based on this groundwork, some well-known software development methodologies and best practices are analyzed with respect on how they support the systematic engineering of trustworthy software. Finally, the state of the art is discussed in a qualitative way, and an outlook on necessary research efforts and technological innovations is given.</p>
