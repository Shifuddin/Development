                          <p class="Para">The aim of this study is to develop a framework for integrated software quality prediction. This integration is reflected by a range of quality attributes incorporated in the model as well as relationships between these attributes. The model is formulated as a Bayesian net, a technique that has already been used in various software engineering studies. The framework enables to incorporate expert knowledge about the domain as well as related empirical data and encode them in the Bayesian net model. Such model may be used in decision support for software analysts and managers.</p>
