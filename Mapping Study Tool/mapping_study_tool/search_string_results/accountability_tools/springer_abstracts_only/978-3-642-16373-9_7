                          <p class="Para">Adherence to laws and regulations imposes important constraints on organizations, for legacy and new systems, both for their design and operation. <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Nòmos</em> is a framework that supports the development of compliant software systems. In this paper, we report on the application of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Nòmos</em> in an industrial project, to provide model-based evidence that a set of requirements for a healthcare information system are compliant with a specific law. Compliance is treated as a collection of assigned responsibilities to social and system actors. The design of compliance pays special attention to auditability, i.e., making sure that design-time compliance is actually being adhered to.</p>
