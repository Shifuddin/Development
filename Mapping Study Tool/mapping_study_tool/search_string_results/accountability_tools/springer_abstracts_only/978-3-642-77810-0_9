                          <p class="Para">There is a huge gap between the theories of computing and the practice of developing applications that must satisfy extremely critical application requirements such as human safety and mission survivability — which in turn may impose stringent demands for computer and communication system reliability, availability, security, integrity, real-time responsiveness, and (in many cases) correctness of the application software. Experience shows that such systems are vulnerable to a wide variety of misfortunes — including malicious misuse (by insiders and outsiders), hardware faults, software flaws, development malpractice, and ‘acts of God’ — with potentially devastating consequences. The challenge is to ensure that development efforts can address these problems, while at the same time recognizing the implications of certain intrinsic limitations, both technological and social.</p>
                          <p class="Para">This paper addresses system requirements, known types of vulnerabilities, past crises that illustrate the difficulties encountered, some constructive techniques for developing dependable systems, and various remaining concerns. Special emphasis is placed on effective structuring of requirements, system designs, and software developments, coordinated under a suitably generalized system perspective capable of transcending narrowly conceived requirements.</p>
