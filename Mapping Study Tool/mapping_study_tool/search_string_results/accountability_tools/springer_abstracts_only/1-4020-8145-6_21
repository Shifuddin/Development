                          <p class="Para">In the context of authorization in distributed systems, security and privacy often seem at odds. Privacy goals motivate the use of privacy-enhanced forms of authorization such as attribute-based, anonymous authorization; the need to identify misbehaving users calls for either identity-based authorization or identity escrow allowing re-identification of users.</p>
                          <p class="Para">We propose a risk-driven design approach for maximizing privacy of users while satisfying security requirements of an application. In this approach, a security measure such as authentication or identity escrow is introduced only if it addresses a concrete risk. The approach helps to identify privacy-friendly solutions as well as trade-offs between privacy and cost considerations. We illustrate our approach with an example application using anonymous credentials.</p>
