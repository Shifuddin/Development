                          <p class="Para">As the ubiquitous computing technology (uT) is prevailing, applying uT is more likely to transform the legacy way of providing services to a new service everywhere, every time, with any devices to gain more comparative advantages than the other typical services. This opportunity naturally requires a methodology to assess to what extent the legacy e-services are transformed to the uT-based services. However, research about assessing the level of u-Transformation has been still very few. Hence, this paper aims to propose a methodology for assessing the level of u-Transformation oriented by the teleology of ubiquitous services. A case study, GPS-based navigation services, is performed to show the feasibility of the methodology addressed in this paper.</p>
