                          <p class="Para">User-related contextual factors affect the degree of privacy protection that is necessary for a given context. Such factors include: sensitivity of data, location of data, sector, contractual restrictions, cultural expectations, user trust (in organisations, etc.), trustworthiness of partners, security deployed in the infrastructure, etc. The relationship between these factors and privacy control measures that should be deployed can be complex. In this paper we propose a decision based support system that assesses context and deduces a list of recommendations and controls. One or more design patterns will be suggested, that can be used in conjunction to satisfy contextual requirements. This is a broad solution that can be used for privacy, security and other types of requirement.</p>
