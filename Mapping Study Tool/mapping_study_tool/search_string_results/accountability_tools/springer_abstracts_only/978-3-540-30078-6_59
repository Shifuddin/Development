                          <p class="Para">Unnoticed for quite some time, electronic Government (e-Government, e-Gov) projects have only recently been observed to induce changes to government business processes. So far, the strategic approaches and objectives pursued in such projects have not been studied. In the private sector, business process change (BPC), in turn, has been widely practiced and researched. In this exploratory study, the existing literature on BPC-related strategic approaches and objectives is used as a point of reference for assessing the scope and scale e-Gov-induced BPC. On a grand scale, the strategic approaches and objectives were found very similar to those used in the private sector, although they differed in many details. The existing knowledge it is concluded can help inform and guide e-Gov projects with a BPC impact.</p>
