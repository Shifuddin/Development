                            <p class="Para">With ever increasing developments in computing technology, approaches to attaining informed consent are becoming outdated. In light of this ongoing change, researchers have begun to propose several new mechanisms to meet the emerging challenges of consent in pervasive settings. Unfortunately a particular problem arises when considering consent in the context of Human-Agent Collectives (HACs). These large-scale heterogeneous networks, of multiple co-operating humans and agents are particularly complex and it is difficult to know <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">what</em>, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">where</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">how</em> to introduce these new mechanisms. In this paper we explore the potential of patterns of interactional arrangement as a framework for embedding consent mechanisms in HACs and other ubiquitous systems.</p>
