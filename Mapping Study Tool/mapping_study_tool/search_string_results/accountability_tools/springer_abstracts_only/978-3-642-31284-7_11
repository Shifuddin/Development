                          <p class="Para">In this paper, we present new attacks on the redactable signature scheme introduced by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Kundu</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Bertino</em> at VLDB ’08. This extends the work done by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Brzuska</em> et al. at ACNS ’10 and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Samelin</em> et al. at ISPEC ’12. The attacks address unforgeability, transparency and privacy. Based on the ideas of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Kundu</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Bertino</em>, we introduce a new provably secure construction. The corresponding security model is more flexible than the one introduced by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Brzuska</em> et al. Moreover, we have implemented the schemes introduced by <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Brzuska</em> et al. and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Kundu</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Bertino</em>. The practical evaluation shows that schemes with a quadratic complexity become unuseable very fast.</p>
