                          <p class="Para">In the next 10 years there will be rapid adoption of health information technology - electronic medical records by providers and personal health records by patients - linked via health information exchange. There is an emergent need to provide secure access to information spread across multiple repositories for health care providers (e.g., physicians, nurses, home health aides, etc.) who collaborate with one another across cyberspace to deliver patient care. Are available security models capable of supporting collaborative access where providers are simultaneously modifying a patientâ€™s medical record? To address this question, this paper details collaborative security extensions to NIST RBAC.</p>
