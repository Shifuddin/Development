                          <p class="Para">This paper presents a framework that employs security ontologies and security patterns to provide application developers with a way to utilize security expertise. Through the development of a security ontology, developers locate the major security-related concepts relevant to their application context. Security patterns are then integrated with these concepts to provide tested solutions for accommodating security requirements.</p>
