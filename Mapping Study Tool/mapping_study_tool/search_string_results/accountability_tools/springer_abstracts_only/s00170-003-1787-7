                          <p class="Para">This study presents the design and development of a Web-based programmable logic controller (PLC) system architecture that supports “hands-on” laboratory exercises in automated manufacturing systems control area for distance education. The system architecture allows remote users to access and control a PLC-based table-top manufacturing system via the Internet. A Web site has been designed and developed that facilitates interactivity and supports PLC programming and control. The architecture has been tested and implemented in the course Emgt 334 Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems at the Integrated Systems Facility (ISF) in the Engineering Management Department at the University of Missouri-Rolla during Fall 2001. This study shows that software tools available in the market can be integrated to develop a fairly complex, yet effective, learning environment for distance education. The architecture presented in this paper is not dependent on specific PLC hardware or software configuration, it represents a generic infrastructure. </p>
