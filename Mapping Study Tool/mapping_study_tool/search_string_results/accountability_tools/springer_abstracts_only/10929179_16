                          <p class="Para">The principle of modularity is more and more applied in the engineering of information systems in e-government. Initiatives are confronted with a highly fragmented ICT-architecture that has been organized around departments and do not or hardly share functionality. A modular architecture can provide common functionality to all information systems and provide the flexibility to include functionality provided by legacy systems, which cannot be replaced easily and otherwise restrict further development. The goal of this paper is to explore the road towards a modular architecture. A case study is committed at the Ministry of Justice to illustrate and evaluate the first steps on this road. Based on this experience we identify the next steps towards market-based modular services architecture.</p>
