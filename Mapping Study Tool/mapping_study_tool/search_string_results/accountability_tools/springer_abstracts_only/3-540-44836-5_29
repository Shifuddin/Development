                          <p class="Para">In this paper we argue that knowledge management is required to improve transparency in e-government processes and to support their social acceptance. We present the main information flows and knowledge management issues identified in the case of the UK Local Authority elections 2<sup>nd</sup> May 2002 electronic voting pilots. We provide a comprehensive view of the major areas of information flows either provided to or produced by the main agents (namely voters, administration staff, local authorities and commercial suppliers) involved in the projects. In doing so we highlight the issues of security, data protection, and transparency of information flows and their relation to the social acceptance of electronically services elections.</p>
