                            <p class="Para">Sharing information allows businesses to take advantage of hidden knowledge, improve work processes and cooperation both within and across organisations. Thus there is a need for improved information protection capable of restricting how information is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">used</em>, as opposed to only accessed. Usage Control has been proposed to achieve this by combining and extending traditional access control, Digital Rights Management and various encryption schemes. Advances in usage control enforcement has received considerable attention from the research community and we therefore believe there is a need to synthesise these efforts to minimise the potential for overlap. This paper surveys the previous efforts on providing <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">usage control</em> enforcement and analyses the general strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. In this paper we demonstrate that there are several promising mechanisms for enforcing usage control, but that reliable empirical evidence is required in order to ensure the appropriateness and usability of the enforcement mechanisms.</p>
