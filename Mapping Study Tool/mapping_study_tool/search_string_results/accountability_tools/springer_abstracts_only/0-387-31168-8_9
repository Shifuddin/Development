                          <p class="Para">Rapid developments in information and communication technologies (ICT) have resulted in the widespread use of the Internet as an important medium for commercial activity. Such activity commonly referred to as electronic commerce, or e-commerce has facilitated new business models in many different commercial endeavours including pharmaceutical and medical practice. This paper investigates the growing phenomenon of drugs sales and medical services over the Internet via Internet Pharmacies. Although Internet Pharmacies have resulted in many benefits to consumers, there are serious health and safety concerns about various aspects of this commercial activity, especially where laws and regulations are not adhered to. Such concerns raise important issues regarding social accountability when using ICT to facilitate the provision of medical services. The paper examines the benefits and problems associated with Internet pharmacies with a view to discussing some of the challenges faced especially by legislators and regulators. It argues that many of these challenges are compounded by the nature of the Internet itself, social and economic realities, different national regulatory structures and the difficulty of enforcing national laws outside of legal jurisdictions. Finally it discusses how some of the present challenges may be addressed.</p>
