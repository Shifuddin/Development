                        <p class="Para">As defined in [Registratiekamer 1995], privacy technologies refer to a variety of technologies that safeguard personal privacy by minimising or eliminating the collection of identifiable data. We extend the definition of privacy technologies to include also security technologies to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data. Thus, extended security criteria for systems with high privacy requirements should cover a diversity of privacy enhancing security aspects such as: <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Privacy-Enhancing Security Aspects for protecting the user identities providing Anonymity, Pseudonymity, Unlinkability, Unobservability of users</em>: The principles of minimisation and avoidance of personal data are derived from the legal principle of necessity of data collecting and processing, which requires that personal data should not be collected or used for identification purposes when not truly necessary.</p>
