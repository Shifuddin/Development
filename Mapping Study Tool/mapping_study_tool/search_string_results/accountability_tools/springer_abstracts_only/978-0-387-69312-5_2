                        <p class="Para">Schools as places for institutionalized learning could be a perfectly suitable domain for knowledge management systems. Making knowledge about teaching and learning as well as school performance available to the relevant stakeholders seems to be a promising approach. The crucial question is how to identify information needs, select the relevant data and how to organize feedback. In this paper, the computer-based support of classroom decisions and school management on the basis of standardized test results will be presented. With the help of these assessment information systems, feedback on different levels for different target groups in the school system can be organized. Reflecting on the rich body of empirical research on management information systems, we will present an example for an assessment information system from Hungary, which has just started with computer-support for data-driven decision-making. This case study illustrates the potential added value for the key stakeholders in the school systems.</p>
