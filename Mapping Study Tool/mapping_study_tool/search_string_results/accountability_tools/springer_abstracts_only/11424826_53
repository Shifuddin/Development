                          <p class="Para">A PP defines an implementation-independent set of IT security requirements for a category of TOEs. Consumers can therefore construct or cite a PP to express their IT security needs without reference to any specific TOE. Generally, PPs contain security assurance requirements about the security of development environment for IT product or system and they are described in ALC_DVS (Development Security) family in the part 3 of the Common Criteria (CC). This paper proposes some security environments for development site by analyzing the compliance between ALC_DVS.1 of the CC and Base Practices (BPs) of the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity.</p>
