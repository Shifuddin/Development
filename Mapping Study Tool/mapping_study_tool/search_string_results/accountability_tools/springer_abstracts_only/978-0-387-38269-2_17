                          <p class="Para">To smooth the cooperation within a VBE, and to facilitate the partner selection for VOs configured in VBEs, the VBE member organizations need to trust each other. Among others, lack of trust relationships among organizations, negatively affects their information exchange and resources sharing. In small-size VBEs, organizations have the chance to get to know each, and thus can individually make their judgment on trustworthiness level of others. For large-size VBEs however, new approaches and mechanisms are required to be designed for measuring/assessing the trustworthiness level of other organizations. This paper first addresses this problem area and its challenges and then classifies it into three focus areas. It then introduces an approach for measuring the trustworthiness level of other organizations, based on both the trust criteria defined by the trustor and the past performance of the trustee. Three trust perspectives pentagon, square, and triangle, are then defined addressing the three problem focus areas.</p>
