                          <p class="Para">Authentication codes (A-codes, for short) are considered as important building blocks for constructing unconditionally secure authentication schemes. Since in the conventional A-codes, two communicating parties, transmitter and receiver, utilized a common secret key, and such A-codes do not provide non-repudiation. With the aim of enhancing with non-repudiation property, Simmons introduced A<sup>2</sup>-codes [16,17]. Later, Johansson [6] formally defined an improved version of A<sup>2</sup>-codes called, the A<sup>3</sup>-codes. Unlike A<sup>2</sup>-codes, A<sup>3</sup>-codes do not require an arbiter to be fully trusted. In this paper, we clarify the security definition of A<sup>3</sup>-codes which may be misdefined. We show a concrete attack against an A<sup>3</sup>-code and conclude that concrete constructions of A<sup>3</sup>-codes implicitly assumes a trusted arbiter. We also show that there is no significant difference between A<sup>2</sup>-codes and A<sup>3</sup>-codes in a practical sense and further argue that it is impossible to construct an “ideal” A<sup>3</sup>-codes, that is, without any trusted arbiter. Finally, we introduce a novel model of asymmetric A-codes with an arbiter but do not have to be fully trusted, and also show a concrete construction of the asymmetric A-codes for the model. Since our proposed A-code does not require fully trusted arbiters, it is more secure than A<sup>2</sup>-codes or A<sup>3</sup>-codes.</p>
