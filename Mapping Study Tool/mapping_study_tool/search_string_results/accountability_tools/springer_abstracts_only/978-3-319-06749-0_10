                          <p class="Para">Along with the rapid growth in adoption of cloud services, there have been developments towards a new emerging concept, called Identity Management as a Service. As the internal IT systems were not designed for externals, the IT solutions from the cloud can solve the challenges of connecting the enterprises to the outer world and consequently, bring all the benefits of the cloud-based services to them.</p>
                          <p class="Para">However, the other side of the coin of moving towards outsourcing identity infrastructure is a set of privacy and security challenges that cannot be neglected. In this paper, we propose an architectural model based on Privacy Preserving Attribute-based Credentials, and show how we can benefit from the advantages of Privacy-ABCs to help the concept of Identity Management as a Service, and address the privacy concerns that it raises.</p>
