                          <p class="Para">The black hole attack is one of the well-known security threats in wireless mobile ad hoc networks. The intruders utilize the loophole to carry out their malicious behaviors because the route discovery process is necessary and inevitable. Many researchers have conducted different detection techniques to propose different types of detection schemes. In this paper, we survey the existing solutions and discuss the state-of-the-art routing methods. We not only classify these proposals into single black hole attack and collaborative black hole attack but also analyze the categories of these solutions and provide a comparison table. We expect to furnish more researchers with a detailed work in anticipation.</p>
