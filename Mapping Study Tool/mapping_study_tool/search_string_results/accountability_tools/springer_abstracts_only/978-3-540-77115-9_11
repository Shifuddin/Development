                          <p class="Para">P2P networks provide a highly reliable way of sharing resources. But the peers have to manage the risk involved due to lack of knowledge about each otherâ€™s trustworthiness. Peers could provide different types of services. For the peers to behave honestly, trust needs to be incorporated. The trust framework should enable assessing the peers based on the services provided by them. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a trust framework for evaluating the trust of peers in a network. The trust framework incorporates self experience and reputation to calculate trustworthiness of a peer. Various strategies like Game Tree strategy, Tit for Tat strategy, Self Trust strategy, Dynamic strategy and Auditing strategy are proposed for selecting peers for doing job and the performance is analysed.</p>
