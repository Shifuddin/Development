                          <p class="Para">Forensic analysis helps identify the causes of crimes and accidents. Determination of cause, however, requires detailed knowledge of a system’s design and operational characteristics. This paper advocates that “use cases,” which specify operational interactions and requirements, and “misuse cases,” which specify potential misuse or abuse scenarios, can be used to analyze and link forensic evidence and create postincident reconstructions. Use-misuse case analysis techniques involving non-probabilistic and probabilistic methods are described and applied to Positive Train Control (PTC) Systems — a network-based automated system that controls the movements of passenger and freight trains.</p>
