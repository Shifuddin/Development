Multi-tenancy is one of key properties of SaaS to achieve higher profit margin by leveraging the economies of scale. This feature empowered by virtualization comes several new complexities introduced related to the area of accountability. For this purpose, we tackle the problem of integrating multi-tenancy in cloud services accountability and determine crucial issues that can be solved. To do this, we propose a multitenant services monitoring approach that keeps monitoring service execution at runtime and detecting privacy violations. This approach is based on multitenant accountability patterns for integrating multi-tenancy architecture and expressing rules that are enforced using AOP. Furthermore, we propose a middleware layer for implementing our approach into conventional cloud architecture. The performed evaluation proves the flexibility and the efficiency of our approach for services based applications in the cloud computing. © 2014 IEEE.",Accountability; Cloud computing; Monitoring; Multi-tenancy; Patterns; Privacy,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937945681

To ensure the operation and security of Bitcoin, it is essential that all transactions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users. Unavoidably, in such a setting, the security of transactions comes at odds with transaction privacy. Motivated by the fact that transaction confirmation in Bitcoin requires tens of minutes, we analyze the conditions for performing successful double-spending attacks against fast payments in Bitcoin, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of a minute). We show that unless new detection techniques are integrated in the Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with considerable probability and can be mounted at low cost. We propose a new and lightweight countermeasure that enables the detection of double-spending attacks in fast transactions. In light of such misbehavior, accountability becomes crucial. We show that in the specific case of Bitcoin, accountability complements privacy. To illustrate this tension, we provide accountability and privacy definition for Bitcoin, and we investigate analytically and empirically the privacy and accountability provisions in Bitcoin. © 2015 Association for Computing Machinery.","Bitcoin; Design; Distributed computing; Double-spending; Economics; Experimentation; K.4.1 [computers and society]: public policy issues - privacy; K.4.4 [computers and society]: electronic commerce - payment schemes, security; Monetization; Privacy; Security; Security",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930850900

Securing data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to secure the data provenance for these devices by exploiting spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless channel that these devices use for communication. Our solution enables two parties to generate closely matching link fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party can later verify the details of the transaction, particularly the wireless link on which the data was transmitted. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge; they are lightweight compared with traditional provenance mechanisms and enable interesting security properties such as accountability, nonrepudiation, and resist man-in-the-middle attacks. We validate our technique with experiments using bodyworn sensors in scenarios approximating actual device deployment and present some extensions, which reduce energy consumption. We believe this is a promising first step toward using wireless-link characteristics for the data provenance in body area networks. © 2014 IEEE.",Body area networks; data provenance; physical layer security,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911072446

The globalization trends encompassing all businesses, and risks of information leakage forces organizations to institute mechanisms to protect it. In order to achieve adequate level of protection, organizations implement information security management systems (ISMS). The effectiveness of ISMS depends on the implementation strength of security controls. Several studies have detailed out the qualitative nature of information security measurements and quantitative studies have always remained a challenge. This empirical study focuses on the information security perceptions of internal users of the organization on the security controls, customer influence and the support provided by the top management. The perception of internal users referred as perceived information security is measured based on the degree of confidence expressed by the internal users towards the security objectives namely, confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability and reliability. In an attempt to align the interest of researchers and practitioners, the study surveys major developments in the field of ISMS and proposes a construct for a holistic comprehension of 'Perceived Information Security'. The survey based research methodology focuses on the perceptions of the internal users such as Security program Implementers, Business Users and Senior Management. The findings of the study in the context of Indian IT services industry have been presented. The contributions of the research paper include providing insights into perceived information security of internal users of the organization, an empirical approach for studying perceived information security and a holistic framework for information security in Indian IT organizations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Information systems security; IT services; Perceived information security; Security audit,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894629697

Due to their central and trusted position in the software ecosystem, coerced, hacked or malicious app markets pose a serious threat to user security. Currently, there is little that hinders a nation state adversary (NSA) or other powerful attackers from using such central and trusted points of software distribution to deploy customized (malicious) versions of apps to specific users. Due to intransparencies in the current app installation paradigm, this kind of attack is extremely hard to detect. In this paper, we evaluate the risks and drawbacks of current app deployment in the face of powerful attackers. We assess the app signing practices of 97% of all free Google Play apps and find that the current practices make targeted attacks unnecessarily easy and almost impossible to detect for users and app developers alike. We show that high profile Android apps employ intransparent and unaccountable strategies when they publish apps to (multiple) alternative markets. We then present and evaluate Application Transparency (AT), a new framework that can defend against ""targeted-and-stealthy"" attacks, mount by malicious markets. We deployed AT in the wild and conducted an extensive field study in which we analyzed app installations on 253,819 real world Android devices that participate in a popular anti-virus app's telemetry program. We find that AT can effectively protect users against malicious targeted attack apps and furthermore adds transparency and accountability to the current intransparent signing and packaging strategies employed by many app developers.

The essential security requirements are accountability, privacy and unlinkability. Unlinkability is a strong notion of privacy. Namely, it makes it hard to link two sanitized messages that were derived from the same message-signature pair. In this work, we strengthen the standard unlinkability definition by Brzuska et al. at PKC’10, making it robust against malicious or buggy signers. While state-of-the art schemes deploy costly group signatures to achieve unlinkability, our construction uses standard digital signatures, which makes them compatible with existing infrastructure. We construct a sanitizable signature scheme that satisfies the strong notion of perfect unlinkability and, simultaneously, achieves the strongest notion of accountability, i.e., non-interactive public accountability. Our construction is not only legally compliant, but also highly efficient, as the measurements of our reference implementation show.

Increasing awareness of privacy issues and events such as the Snowden disclosures have led to the rapid growth of a new generation of anonymous social networks and messaging applications. By removing traditional concepts of strong identities and social links, these services encourage communication between strangers, and allow users to express themselves without fear of bullying or retaliation. Despite millions of users and billions of monthly page views, there is little empirical analysis of how services like Whisper have changed the shape and content of social interactions. In this paper, we present results of the first large-scale empirical study of an anonymous social network, using a complete 3-month trace of the Whisper network covering 24 million whispers written by more than 1 million unique users. We seek to understand how anonymity and the lack of social links affect user behavior. We analyze Whisper from a number of perspectives, including the structure of user interactions in the absence of persistent social links, user engagement and network stickiness over time, and content moderation in a network with minimal user accountability. Finally, we identify and test an attack that exposes Whisper users to detailed location tracking. We have notified Whisper and they have taken steps to address the problem.

It is the process of mediating every request to resources and data maintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied. The access control decision is enforced by a mechanism implementing regulations established by a security policy. There are some typical security policies of access control. The mainstream operating systems is inadequate to support multi-policy at the same time for enforcing different access control decision. Integrity of multi-policy is an important part of access control research in secure systems. Trusted recovery is the necessary function of high-level security operating system. The objective of trusted recovery is to ensure the maintenance of the security and accountability properties of a system in the face of failures. This paper presents a trusted recovery monitoring model, which can solve some limits of strict security policy for access control. Firstly, the framework of model is given. The formal Clark-Wilson model and its improved model PCW (Povey's Clark-Wilson) are implemented by configuring TE (type enforcement) and RBAC (role-based access control) model. Secondly, combining the characteristics of a file system in operating system, this paper presents how to recover the file system to its last consistency secure state, in conservative and optimistic recovery policy respectively, by analyzing audit logs and undoing some malicious operations. This method can recover the system to a secure state in the face of failures and improves the availability of the system. It provides an important exploration for the design and implementation of the trusted recovery mechanisms of our own high-level secure operating system.",Access control; Information security; Integrity policy; Security operating system; Trusted recovery,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896054782

We demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach by applying it on the development of the US government's process workflow for implementing, certifying, and accrediting cross-domain computer security solutions. Our approach involves identifying human-in-the-loop decision points in the process activities and then modeling these via statechart assertions. We developed techniques to specify and enforce workflow hierarchies, which was a challenge due to the existence of concurrent activities within complex workflow processes. Some of the key advantages of our approach are: it results in development of a model that is executable, supporting both upfront and runtime checking of process-workflow requirements; aids comprehension and communication among stakeholders and process engineers; and provides for incorporating accountability and risk management into the engineering of process workflows. © 2014 IEEE.",Formal methods; information assurance; process modeling; software engineering; statechart assertions; verification and validation,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898493928

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service rather than a product, whereby shared resources, software and information are provided to computers and other devices as a utility over a network. The imperative feature of cloud services is that the user data are frequently processed remotely in unidentified machines that users do not own or operate. Due to this reason, the data owner loss their original data and it becomes an important obstruction to the extensive implementation of cloud services. This study introduces the term data accountability based encryption and users can substitute to a Third-Party Auditor (TPA) for the verification of data integrity problem.

The organisations that collect this data need to manage the privacy of these individuals. In many organisations there are insufficient data protection measures and a low level of trust among those whose data are concerned. It is often difficult and burdensome for organisations to prove privacy compliance and accountability especially in situations that cross national boundaries and involve a number of different legal systems governing privacy. In response to these obstacles, we describe instruments facilitating accountability, audit, and meaningful certification. These instruments are based on a set of fundamental data protection goals (DPG): availability, integrity, confidentiality, transparency, intervenability, and unlinkability. By using the data protection goals instead of focusing on fragmented national privacy regulations, a well defined set of privacy metrics can be identified recognising privacy by design requirements and widely accepted certification criteria. We also describe a novel conceptual framework and architecture for defining comprehensive privacy compliance metrics and providing assessment tools for ICT applications and services using as much automation as possible. The proposed metrics and tools will identify gaps, provide clear suggestions and will assist audit and certification to support informed decisions on the trustworthiness of ICT for citizens and businesses. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927602198

In this paper, we present Progger (Provenance Logger), a kernel-space logger which potentially empowers all cloud stakeholders to trace their data. Logging from the kernel space empowers security analysts to collect provenance from the lowest possible atomic data actions, and enables several higher-level tools to be built for effective end-to-end tracking of data provenance. Within the last few years, there has been an increasing number of proposed kernel space provenance tools but they faced several critical data security and integrity problems. Some of these prior tools' limitations include (1) the inability to provide log tamper-evidence and prevention of fake/manual entries, (2) accurate and granular timestamp synchronisation across several machines, (3) log space requirements and growth, and (4) the efficient logging of root usage of the system. Progger has resolved all these critical issues, and as such, provides high assurance of data security and data activity audit. With this in mind, the paper will discuss these elements of high-assurance cloud data provenance, describe the design of Progger and its efficiency, and present compelling results which paves the way for Progger being a foundation tool used for data activity tracking across all cloud systems. © 2014 IEEE.",Accountability; Cloud Computing; Data Provenance; Data Security; Tamper-evident logging; Time Synchronisation,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919819887

Privacy infringement has the potential to lead to serious consequences for the stakeholders involved, hence researchers and organisations have developed various privacy enhancing techniques and tools. However, there is no solution that fits all, and there are instances where privacy solutions could be misused, for example to hide nefarious activities. Therefore, it is important to provide suitable measures and to make necessary design tradeoffs in order to avoid such misuse. This short paper aims to make a case for the need of careful consideration when designing a privacy solution, such that the design effectively addresses the user requirements while at the same time minimises the risk of inadvertently assisting potential offenders. In other words, this paper strives to promote ""sensible privacy"" design, which deals with the complex challenges in balancing privacy, usability and accountability. We illustrate this idea through a case study involving the design of privacy solutions for domestic violence survivors. This is the main contribution of the paper. The case study presents specific user requirements and operating conditions, which coupled with the attacker model, provide a complex yet interesting scenario to explore. One example of our solutions is described in detail to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.

But in Cloud environment, lacking of cyber security users may suffer a serious data loss without any compensation for they have lost all their control on their data. Cyber security is the body of technologies and it is designed to protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. Security audit is an important solution enabling trace back and analysis of any activities including data accesses, security breaches, application activities, and so on. Provable data possession (PDP) is an audit technique for ensuring the security of data in storage outsourcing. However, this existing audit schemes have focused on static data and the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection is very challenging task. For the cyber security we present a novel way implementation of a Trust Enhanced Third Party Auditor (TETPA), a trusted and easy-to- use auditor for Cloud environment. TETPA enables the Cloud Service Providers' accountability, and protects the Cloud users' benefits. Moreover our audit service is using for dynamic integrity verification in multi cloud storage.

Open data are increasingly generating new business worldwide, providing citizens with a wealth of information that they can combine and aggregate in unprecedented ways. An important characteristic of open data environments is that once the data are published, it is difficult to anticipate how the data will be used. As a result, potentially innocuous datasets, once linked together, may lead to serious privacy violations, and powerful analytic tools may reveal sensitive patterns that were unknown at the time that the data were published. In this paper, we provide an introduction to data privacy and present some popular privacy models that have been proposed for privacy-preserving data publishing and knowledge hiding, focusing on their strengths and limitations.

A key design goal for any group decision-making system is the promotion of participation, yet there is little research that explores how the features of digital voting systems themselves can be shaped to configure participation appropriately. In this paper we propose a framework that explores the design space of digital voting from the perspective of participation. We ground our discussion in the design of a social media polling tool called BallotShare; a first instantiation of our proposed framework designed to facilitate the study of decision-making practices in a workplace environment. Across five weeks, participants created and took part in non-standard polls relating to events and other spontaneous group decisions. Following interviews with participants we identified significant drivers and limitations of individual and collective participation in the voting process: social visibility, social inclusion, commitment and delegation, accountability, influence and privacy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite very recent interests from the cyber security community on some specific aspects of data provenance, there is no long-haul, overarching, systematic framework for the security and privacy of provenance. The importance of secure provenance R&D has been emphasized in the recent report on Federal game-changing R&D for cyber security especially with respect to the theme of Tailored Trustworthy Spaces. Secure data provenance can significantly enhance data trustworthiness, which is crucial to various decision-making processes. Moreover, data provenance can facilitate accountability and compliance (including compliance with privacy preferences and policies of relevant users), can be an important factor in access control and usage control decisions, and can be valuable in data forensics. Along with these potential benefits, data provenance also poses a number of security and privacy challenges. For example, sometimes provenance needs to be confidential so it is visible only to properly authorized users, and we also need to protect the identity of entities in the provenance from exposure. We thus need to achieve high assurance of provenance without comprising privacy of those in the chain that produced the data. Moreover, if we expect voluntary large-scale participation in provenance-aware applications, we must assure that the privacy of the individuals or organizations involved will be maintained. It is incumbent on the cyber security community to develop a technical and scientific framework to address the security and privacy challenges so that our society can gain maximum benefit from this technology. In this paper, we discuss a framework of theoretical foundations, models, mechanisms and architectures that allow applications to benefit from privacy-enhanced and secure use of provenance in a modular fashion. After introducing the main components of such a framework and the notion of provenance life cycle, we discuss in details research questions and issues concerning each such component and related approaches. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Accountability and compliance; Cryptography and access control; Data provenance; Privacy; Risk management; Security; Trustworthy computing,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920257881

Unfortunately, there are very few cryptographic systems allowing practical attribute-based access control system implementations. The lack of cryptographic schemes is caused by the fact that the good balance between privacy and accountability is very difficult to achieve.

Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching 'link' fingerprints which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. We validate our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment, and we present optimization mechanisms.

This inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e.g. file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy violations by analysing the data provenance. S2Logger also enables us to address the gaps and inadequacies of existing system-centric security tools. © 2013 IEEE.",accountability in cloud computing; Cloud Computing; cloud computing security; cloud computing transparency; Cloud data provenance; data tracing; data tracking; file tracking; S2Logger,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893504038

With the emergence of the cloud and the benefits it encompasses, there has been a rapid proliferation of services being adopted by commercial and government sectors. However, trust and security concerns for such services are on an unprecedented scale. Currently, these services expose very little internal working to their customers; this can cause accountability and compliance issues especially in the event of a fault or error, customers and providers are left to point finger at each other. Provenance-based traceability provides a mean to address part of this problem by being able to capture and query events occurred in the past to understand how and why it took place. However, due to the complexity of the cloud infrastructure, the current provenance models lack the expressibility required to describe the inner-working of a cloud service. For a complete solution, a provenance-aware policy language is also required for operators and users to define policies for compliance purpose. The current policy standards do not cater for such requirement. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a provenance (traceability) model cProv, and a provenance-aware policy language (cProvl) to capture traceability data, and express policies for validating against the model. For implementation, we have extended the XACML3.0 architecture to support provenance, and provided a translator that converts cProvl policy and request into XACML type. © 2013 IEEE.",Cloud; CProv; CProvl; Data traceability; Policy language; Prov; Provenance; XACML,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893214205

The original notion of accountability does not satisfy European legal standards, while non-interactive public accountability does. A contradictory security goal is the indistinguish ability of message-signature pairs from the signer and the sanitizer, a.k.a. transparency. As state-of-the-art schemes often satisfy transparency, they can only achieve a weaker notion of accountability. We show that non-interactive public accountability does not contradict privacy by proving that an existing scheme by Brzuska et al. (BIOSIG '09) satisfies both notions. We then extend the scheme to also satisfy blockwise public accountability.

Using the guidelines provided in the Information Protection Playbook, security and information technology (IT) managers will learn how to implement the five functions of an IP framework: governance, program planning, risk management, incident response management, and program administration. These functions are based on a model promoted by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and validated by thousands of Certified Information Security Managers. The five functions are further broken down into a series of objectives or milestones to be achieved in order to implement an IP framework. The extensive appendices included at the end of the book make for an excellent resource for the security or IT manager building an IP program from the ground up. They include, for example, a board of directors presentation complete with sample slides; an IP policy document checklist; a risk prioritization procedure matrix, which illustrates how to classify a threat based on a scale of high, medium, and low; a facility management self-assessment questionnaire; and a list of representative job descriptions for roles in IP.

Designing and implementing privacy-preserving distributed systems, however, is challenging since these systems also have to fulfill seemingly conflicting security properties and system requirements: e.g., authorization and accountability require some form of user authentication and session management necessarily involves some form of user tracking. In this work, we present a solution based on declarative design. The core component of our framework is a logic-based declarative API for data processing that exports methods to conveniently specify the system architecture and the intended security properties, and conceals the cryptographic realization. Invisible to the programmer, the implementation of this API relies on a powerful combination of digital signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge, pseudonyms, and reputation lists. We formally proved that the cryptographic implementation enforces the security properties expressed in the declarative specification.

This paper discusses the motives to open up an intranet of things and make the things part of the global IoT, identifies the requirements from the involved parties, and extracts the essential architectural implications from these requirements. The proposed solution comprises the definition and control of Access Rights to the discovery and use of Virtual Objects (VO). This approach builds upon the widely accepted view that Virtual Objects serve as digital representation and gateway to Real World Objects (sensors, actuators, etc), and where VO databases serve to find these virtual counterparts. The Access Rights determine not only who may use a function of a Virtual Object and the conditions for that access, but also determine their discoverability when searching the database of virtual objects counterparts. Access Rights solve important requirements for security, privacy, and accountability, that are prerequisite to the expected economic and innovation benefits of an internet of things across organisational domains. Since verification of Access Rights to a VO plays a central role in the deployment of the IoT the scalable implementation with semantic technologies remains a challenge. © 2013 IEEE.",access rights; actuator; Internet of Things; sensor; virtual object,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883734577

For this purpose, the social network information needs to be published publicly or before a specialized group.

Due to this problem, social network data need to be anonymized before its publication in order to prevent potential reidentification attacks.

However, most of the known anonymisation approaches such as suppression or generalization do not directly apply to social network data. One major challenge in social network anonymization is the complexity. In (Gross and Yellen (2006) Graph theory and its applications. CRC, Boca Raton), it has been proved that a particular k-anonymity problem trying to minimize the structural change to the original social network is NP-hard. Research in anonymization of social networks is a relatively new field. In this chapter, we provide a systematic study of different approaches and studies done so far in this direction. There is no doubt that social network nodes can have imprecise data as their attributes. So, normal methods proposed for anonymization are not suitable for such type of social networks. Recently, a very efficient rough set-based algorithm was established in (Tripathy and Prakash Kumar, Int J Rapid Manuf 1(2):189-207, 2009) to handle clustering of tuples in relational models. We shall describe how this algorithm can be used for anonymization of social networks. Also, we shall present some recent algorithms which use isomorphism of graphs for anonymization of social networks. In the end, we shall discuss the current status of research on anonymization of social networks and present some related problems for further study. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.

It assures that every action executed in the system can be traced back to some entity. Accountability is even more crucial for assuring the safety and security of grid systems, given the very large number of users active in these sophisticated environments. However, no comprehensive approach to accountability for grid systems presently exists. Our work addresses this inadequacy by developing a comprehensive accountability system driven by policies and supported by accountability agents. In this paper, we first discuss the requirements that have driven the design of our accountability system and then discuss the key elements of our accountability framework. We also show how accountability data can be used to detect anomalies performed by exploiting resources, such as computing power and/or network bandwidth, etc., made available by grid systems and then protect systems from these malicious actions. A model for optimizing a time frequency to monitor a queue usage is introduced as an example to be used in the initial step of the detection against the anomalous usage patterns of a monitored object. We describe a fully operational implementation of our accountability system and report the results from extensive experimental evaluations of it. Our experiments, carried out using an emulated laboratory test-bed, demonstrate that the implemented system is efficient and scalable for grid systems consisting of large numbers of resources and users. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Accountability; Agents; Distributed denial of service attack; Grid computing,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881377504

Moreover, a gamut of proprietary and safety applications, such as location-based services and pay-as-you-drive systems, are going to be offered to the vehicles. The emerging applications are posing new challenges for the existing Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI) architectures to support Authentication, Authorization and Accountability (AAA), without exposing vehicle privacy. In this work we present an implementation of a VPKI that is compatible with the VC standards. We propose the use of tickets as cryptographic tokens to provide AAA and also preserve vehicle privacy against adversaries and the VPKI.

In its search for solutions to address privacy dilemmas raised by smart meters, the Government has been content with using data protection principles as a policy framework to regulate the processing of consumers' personal information. This is worrying since the question of who has access to what type of information and how it is used cannot simply be regarded as raising information security, authenticity and integrity issues. If we are to go beyond the rhetoric of protecting the privacy rights of energy consumers we must scrutinise the context in which legitimate interests and reasonable expectations of privacy subsist. To remedy this apparent policy oversight, the paper undertakes two tasks: first, to clarify the content and application of data protection and privacy rights to smart meters; and second, it outlines a policy framework that will address the lack of specificity on how best innovation and privacy issues can be better calibrated. More importantly, it calls for targeted substantive reforms, development of accessible privacy policies and information management practices that promote transparency and accountability and deployment of technological solutions that will help reduce emerging fault lines between innovation and privacy in this sphere of energy policymaking. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Data protection; Privacy; Smart meters,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875989531

We motivate these issues for the case of secure logging, a basic accountability property of Cloud applications. We propose an initial version of a DSL for flexible and expressive control over the execution of service compositions on the three abstraction levels: service orchestrations, interceptors and service implementations. We also present a corresponding prototype tool and infrastructure for the manipulation of service compositions at all three levels that we have implemented over Apache CXF.

In this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we construct the first LTRS scheme that is secure without requiring the ROM. Further, we enhance the security of a threshold ring signature (for both linkable or non-linkable) by providing a stronger definition of anonymity. This strengthened notion makes threshold ring signature schemes more suitable in real life. Finally, we provide efficient schemes that outperform the existing schemes in the literature.

There are many Agent Platforms developed by the agent community, but they hardly consider privacy. This leads to agent-based applications that invade users' privacy. Privacy can be threatened by two main information activities: information collection and information processing. Information collection can be prevented using traditional security mechanisms. Information processing can be prevented by minimizing data identifiability, i.e.; the degree by which personal information can be directly attributed to a particular individual. However, minimizing data identifiability may directly affect other crucial issues in Multi-agent Systems, such as accountability, trust, and reputation. In this paper, we present the support that the Magentix2 Agent Platform provides for preserving privacy. Specifically, it provides mechanisms to avoid information collection and information processing when they are not desired. Moreover, Magentix2 provides these mechanisms without compromising accountability, trust, and reputation. We also provide in this paper an application built on top of Magentix2 that exploits its support for preserving privacy. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of the support that Magentix2 provides for preserving privacy based on that application. We specifically test whether or not privacy loss can be minimized by using the support that Magentix2 provides, whether or not this support introduces a bearable performance overhead, and whether or not existing trust and reputation models can be implemented on top of Magentix2. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In an effort to protect user privacy and decrease provider dependence, decentralization has been proposed for SNS. This decentralization has effects on availability, opportunities for traffic analysis, resource requirements, cooperation and incenctives, trust and accountability for different entities, and performance. In this paper, we explore the spectrum of SNS implementations from centralized to fully decentralized and several hybrid constellations in between. Taking a systematic approach of SNS layers, decentralization classes, and replication strategies, we investigate the design space and focus on two issues as concrete examples where the contrast of extreme ends of the decentralization spectrum is illustrative, namely potential adversaries and churn-related profile availability. In general, our research indicates that hybrid approaches deserve more attention as both centralized as well as entirely decentralized systems suffer from severe drawbacks. © 2012 ACM.",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871348269

We defend that security is an essential feature to deploy in any kind of system. Security in conventional systems is a currently unsolved challenge and new attacks and vulnerabilities of systems arise everyday, in AAL systems the problem is even more complex since whether security challenges are hard in homogeneous solutions these escalate when moving to highly dynamic and heterogeneous systems. Several technical solutions have been proposed for specific security components in AAL systems, but the problem to solve the security of the whole system is still open. We address this problem providing a security architecture for the universAAL infrastructure.

Requirements engineers that develop software for regulated domains, such as healthcare or finance, must adapt their software as laws change to maintain legal compliance. In the United States, regulatory agencies will almost always release a proposed regulation, or rule, and accept comments from the public. The agency then considers these comments when drafting a final rule that will be binding on the regulated domain. Herein, we examine how these proposed rules evolve into final rules, and propose an Adaptability Framework. This framework can aid software engineers in predicting what areas of a proposed rule are most likely to evolve, allowing engineers to begin building towards the more stable sections of the rule.

There is an immediate need for building accountability within anonymous systems. In this paper, we show that although accountability appears to be contradictory to and may impair anonymity, it is technically feasible to combine anonymity and accountability into one framework, namely Accountable Anonymity. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts trying to achieve both accountability and anonymity. We propose an efficient proxy reencryption based design that allows normal activities to be done in anonymous manner, while keeping malicious/criminal operations accountable at the same time.

There is no comprehensive federal law governing the protection of data held by private actors. Only those entities covered by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C. §§6801-6809, (certain financial institutions) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. §1320d et seq., and amendments to HIPAA contained in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), P.L. 111-5, (certain health care facilities) are required explicitly by federal law to report data breaches. If private companies have indicated in their privacy policies that they will notify individuals upon a suspected data breach, failure to provide such notification may be considered to be an unfair and deceptive trade practice under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). However, the FTC does not explicitly require private actors in possession of data related to individuals to notify individuals or the federal government should a data breach occur. Forty-six states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted laws requiring notification upon a data security breach involving personal information. However, these laws may vary in their application. They may only apply to certain entities or to certain data. Furthermore, companies maintaining stores of personal data may find it difficult to comply with the potentially different requirements of various state laws. A combination of a lack of a comprehensive federal law addressing security breaches involving personal data and the difficulty industry participants report in complying with various state laws has led Congress to propose a number of bills that would require private actors in possession of personal data to report breaches of that data. The Senate Judiciary Committee recently approved and reported three bills that would create federal standards for data breach notification: S. 1151, the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2011 (Chairman Leahy); S. 1408, the Data Breach Notification Act of 2011 (Senator Feinstein); and S. 1535, the Personal Data Protection and Breach Accountability Act of 2011 (Senator Blumenthal).

A challenging scenario arises in GPS-denied environments when the team operates inside a building, in the urban canyon, underground, in foliage, or under the forest canopy. As an industry leader in navigation technologies, Honeywell has been researching and developing personal navigation equipment. For instance, the DRM™ 4000 is a dead-reckoning system based on the fusion of IMU and compass information. This system is low-cost and capable of GPS-denied navigation in the absence of large magnetic disturbances. Moreover, Honeywell has been developing advanced techniques for aiding personal navigation by estimating displacements using gait models. This paper presents an enhanced Personal Inertial Navigation System (ePINS) solution to the problem of personnel location in GPS-denied environments. The technical approach is based on a strapdown navigation solution maintained using a mid grade IMU and wavelet based motion classification algorithms. This is a follow up of the DARPA SUO SAS and iPINS programs, and is currently being applied to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Geo-spatial Location Accountability and Navigation System for Emergency Responders (GLANSER) and the DARPA Robust Surface Navigation (RSN) programs. The ePINS device can achieve closed path performance of <2% distance traveled for both indoor and outdoor environments. The ePINS consists of a MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (three gyroscopes and three accelerometers), a barometric pressure sensor, and a GPS receiver. The ePINS algorithms combine inertial navigation, barometric altitude, and wavelet motion classification methods to minimize the errors inherent in sensor-based systems, while achieving the system performance, size, and cost objectives. The motion classification uses a wavelet descriptor based classification on the IMU data and is capable of identifying typical human motion modes, including walking, running, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, stopping, crawling, etc. This process is generic enough to allow new motion types to be added to the classification scheme easily. The step-length model is also described, wherein the step length of each motion as a function of frequency and biometric information of the person (e.g., height). After that, we use an extended Kalman filter update using the step length calculated from the trained model to correct the navigation solution. A heading initialization process is also described, which involves walking a circular path in the presence of GPS.",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879638626

With the use of the Cloud computing, many businesses get affordable and convenient access to computing resources, storage, networking and sophisticated software and services that might not otherwise be able to afford. However, based on number of surveys, it is evident that customers have still distrust in the cloud services. To achieve customer's trust in the cloud, there is a required immediate attention to find a solution for it. In this paper, we have tried to achieve customer trust about cloud application execution in the cloud. We have described trust approach with the help of system controls (e.g. preventive, detective and corrective) in the context of various components of trust (e.g. procedural security and privacy, accountability, auditability and fault recovery).

Under HIPAA all Covered Entities are required to ensure compliance with certain privacy and security rules concerned with protecting private patient health information. Building upon the objectives of HIPAA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, in Section 13411 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct periodic audits of Covered Entities against HIPAA Security Rule. This paper presents and evaluates a new approach which might be used by Covered Entities to achieve compliance with HIPAA by adopting the ISO 9001 guidelines. A United States based Healthcare IT Company (UHITC) with a backup office in Pakistan was taken as a case study for this approach. UHITC develops software for mobile devices along with providing third party medical billing services. In connection with its achieving ISO 9001 certification since 2004, UHITC had already developed a company-wide quality audit protocol based on the ISO 9001 standard. For purposes of conforming the ISO standards to the HIPAA audit protocol in a streamlined fashion, UHITC examined the HIPAA requirements to determine whether the existing protocol could be tailored to achieve HIPAA compliance. In order to accomplish this evaluation, the two standards were compared by cross-mapping their components. The comparison revealed that the controls mentioned in the ISO 9001 guideline meet or exceed the HIPAA Security Rule for 36% of the implementation requirements. UHITC was also able to increase customer satisfaction by achieving compliance with HIPAA Security Rule using a quality management system (QMS) model. At the next level, Compliance Attributes (CA) were derived from these requirements and classified as architectural and non-architectural in nature. A new approach to define compliance oriented software architecture using compliance tactic was also proposed. © 2012 IEEE.",HIPAA; HIPAA compliance and QMS intermapping; ISO; software architecture and OCR Audit Program,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867967477

Prior work suggests that affordances of social media might highlight and shape these tensions; to explore this, we asked 20 people to reflect daily for two weeks on feelings and decisions around their own and others'Facebook use related to their relationships. Most generally, we find that tensions arise when romantic partners must manage multiple relationships simultaneously because Facebook audiences are so present and so varied. People also engage in subtle negotiation around and appropriation of Facebook's features to accomplish both personal and relational goals. By capturing both why people make these decisions and how Facebook's affordances support them, we expect our findings to generalize to many other social media tools and to inform theorizing about how these tools affect relational development.

There is a lack of accountability for the content that is shared by peers and it is hard to distinguish malicious users from honest peers. Establishing Trust relationship between peers can serve as the metric to determine the veracity of the shared content and reliability of the peers. Most of the research work in this area is on Reputation based trust management where trust is determined on the basis of recommendation of other peers. Such recommendations are subjective and can be biased. A number of peers can also collude to provide false testimony for malicious peers. This paper proposes a novel Trust model that combines peer profiling with anomaly detection technique. Each peer can establish trust based on its own prior activities with other peers by comparing the current activity of a peer with its historical data and Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been employed to detect the anomalous behavior. Peer profile is updated dynamically with every transaction using GA operator's crossover and mutation. This model has been tested using a file sharing application against common attacks and the results obtained are compared with statistical anomaly detection approach. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Anomaly detection; Chromosome; Genetic algorithm; P2P trust; Peer anonymity; Rule base systems; Trust model,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856414200

However an increasing number of applications will require secure services in order to restrict group membership and enforce accountability of group members. This paper presents a novel architecture for digital identity management. An anonymous authentication protocol that not only allows much lower computational complexity for practical use but also meets requirements of dynamic groups is proposed. This contribution is to provide the strict analysis of security based on the framework of provable security. The protocol consists of an Authorizing Agent (AA), a Group Controller (GC) and an Access Provider (AP). In the protocol, the AP and GC does not possess any information needed to identify the users in the group. In particular, this protocol is suitable for Electronic Health Record Management (EHRM) where several users register to access patient details. The change of participating entities in a group occurs frequently. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an emergent collective intelligence of groups of simple autonomous agents. The problem of cumulative member removal is explored and an ACO based Boolean Function Minimization Technique (BFMT) for group rekeying is employed in the protocol. Termed Ant Colony Optimized Boolean Expression Evolver (ABXE), the novel technique serves to efficiently obtain a minimized Boolean expression while overcoming the drawbacks of the existing BFMT techniques, for group rekeying. Simulation results are shown to prove that the ABXE found minimized Booleanexpression represents the minimum number of messages required to distribute minimum number of keys to the users accessing the EHRM system thereby reducing the communication overhead. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In our architecture, we first introduce two routing hierarchies: local routing on specific network layer protocols/addresses and global routing on a coarser granularity in order to improve the routing scalability. The end-to-end routes are composed of local IP-level forwarding and global transit tunnels on higher routing hierarchy. Secondly we propose ""pair-wise"" routing on the coarser granularity which may facilitate source authentication and inter-domain accountability. On the data plane, an inter-domain path is composed of concatenated local transit tunnels within administration boundaries which should comply with corresponding local transit policies. In addition to enhanced scalability, security and accountability, our new routing architecture may facilitate Internet-wide deployment of new network layer protocols and leverage IP evolution in the long run. © 2011 ACM.",Architecture; Inter-domain; Internet; Routing,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862930876

In this paper a method for feature extraction is proposed which aims to keep only the angle related features that are independent of identity. Moreover a performance study is provided aiming to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed approach.

EPRs support efficient access to patient data by healthcare providers and third party users, which will consequently improve patient care. However, uncontrolled access to distributed EPRs can introduce serious concerns related to patient privacy. This indicates that there is a need for a stronger fine-grained access control mechanism to be used in e-health applications. This paper, therefore, presents a novel method to support access to distributed EPRs with three levels of patient identity privacy preservation. The method offers a number of significant features: (1) it makes use of credentials to support the three-levels of accesses; (2) it simplifies key management distribution; (3) it allows better performance; (4) it supports separation of duties among trusted third parties (ensuring accountability); (5) it improves scalability. The method makes use of cryptographic primitives. In comparison with related work, the method supports three levels of access requirements while preserving data owner's privacy on a single platform. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin.",Credentials; Distributed EPRs; e-Health; Identity Privacy (Anonymity); Linkability; Performance; Security,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-82155166483

Because these devices can be linked to the movement of individuals, there is significant danger that the aggregate computation will violate the location privacy of individuals. This paper develops and evaluates PrivStats, a system for computing aggregate statistics over location data that simultaneously achieves two properties: first, provable guarantees on location privacy even in the face of any side information about users known to the server, and second, privacy-preserving accountability (i.e., protection against abusive clients uploading large amounts of spurious data). PrivStats achieves these properties using a new protocol for uploading and aggregating data anonymously as well as an efficient zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol we developed from scratch for accountability. We implemented our system on Nexus One smartphones and commodity servers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PrivStats is a practical system: computing a common aggregate (e.g., count) over the data of 10, 000 clients takes less than 0.46 s at the server and the protocol has modest latency (0.6 s) to upload data from a Nexus phone.

We then examine the state of the practice in access control by evaluating four open source EHR systems using these 25 evaluation criteria. Our research indicates that the NIST Meaningful Use criteria provide HIPAA compliance, but none of the regulatory and certification criteria address the implementation standards, and best practices related to access control. Additionally, our results indicate that open source EHR system designers are not implementing robust access control mechanisms for the adequate protection of patient data. © 2011 ACM.",access control; electronic health records; health it; healthcare; privacy; role-based access control,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959434633

Very recently, motivated by reducing the trust assumption on the authority, and enhancing the privacy of users, a multiple-authority key-policy ABE system, together with a semi- generic anonymous key-issuing protocol, have been proposed by Chase and Chow in CCS 2009. Since ABE allows encryption for multiple users with attributes satisfying the same policy, it may not be always possible to associate a decryption key to a particular individual. A misbehaving user could abuse the anonymity by leaking the key to someone else, without worrying of being traced. In this paper, we propose a multi-authority ciphertext-policy (AND gates with wild-card) ABE scheme with accountability, which allows tracing the identity of a misbehaving user who leaked the decryption key to others, and thus reduces the trust assumptions not only on the authorities but also the users. The tracing process is efficient and its computational overhead is only proportional to the length of the identity.

For instance, provenance enables the reproducibility of scientific results; provenance is necessary to track attribution and credit in curated databases; and, it is essential for reasoners to make trust judgements about the information they use over the Semantic Web. As the Web allows information sharing, discovery, aggregation, filtering and flow in an unprecedented manner, it also becomes very difficult to identify, reliably, the original source that produced an information item on the Web. Since the emerging use of provenance in niche applications is undoubtedly demonstrating the benefits of provenance, this monograph contends that provenance can and should reliably be tracked and exploited on the Web, and investigates the necessary foundations to achieve such a vision. Multiple data sources have been used to compile the largest bibliographical database on provenance so far. This large corpus permits the analysis of emerging trends in the research community. Specifically, the CiteSpace tool identifies clusters of papers that constitute research fronts, from which characteristics are extracted to structure a foundational framework for provenance on the Web. Such an endeavour requires a multi-disciplinary approach, since it requires contributions from many computer science sub-disciplines, but also other non-technical fields given the human challenge that is anticipated. To develop such a vision, it is necessary to provide a definition of provenance that applies to the Web context. A conceptual definition of provenance is expressed in terms of processes, and is shown to generalise various definitions of provenance commonly encountered. Furthermore, by bringing realistic distributed systems assumptions, this definition is refined as a query over assertions made by applications. Given that the majority of work on provenance has been undertaken by the database, workflow and e-science communities, some of their work is reviewed, contrasting approaches, and focusing on important topics believed to be crucial for bringing provenance to the Web, such as abstraction, collections, storage, queries, workflow evolution, semantics and activities involving human interactions. However, provenance approaches developed in the context of databases and workflows essentially deal with closed systems. By that, it is meant that workflow or database management systems are in full control of the data they manage, and track their provenance within their own scope, but not beyond. In the context of the Web, a broader approach is required by which chunks of provenance representation can be brought together to describe the provenance of information flowing across multiple systems. For this purpose, this monograph puts forward the Open Provenance Vision, which is an approach that consists of controlled vocabulary, serialisation formats and interfaces to allow the provenance of individual systems to be expressed, connected in a coherent fashion, and queried seamlessly. In this context, the Open Provenance Model is an emerging community-driven representation of provenance, which has been actively used by some 20 teams to exchange provenance information, in line with the Open Provenance Vision. After identifying an open approach and a model for provenance, techniques to expose provenance over the Web are investigated. In particular, Semantic Web technologies are discussed since they have been successfully exploited to express, query and reason over provenance. Symmetrically, Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, underpinning the Linked Data effort, are analysed since they offer their own difficulties with respect to provenance. A powerful argument for provenance is that it can help make systems transparent, so that it becomes possible to determine whether a particular use of information is appropriate under a set of rules. Such capability helps make systems and information accountable. To offer accountability, provenance itself must be authentic, and rely on security approaches, which are described in the monograph. This is then followed by systems where provenance is the basis of an auditing mechanism to check past processes against rules or regulations. In practice, not all users want to check and audit provenance, instead, they may rely on measures of quality or trust; hence, emerging provenance-based approaches to compute trust and quality of data are reviewed. © 2010 L.

Several unaddressed threats still limit the effectiveness of reputation systems. Furthermore, most existing work on reputations has focused on accurate reputations for stable systems, but not examined the implications of integrating user reputations into scalable distributed infrastructures. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate and address the critical open challenges that limit the effectiveness of reputations. First, we identify a thorough taxonomy on reputation management, and use it as our framework to classify adversarial threats that compromise reliable operation of reputation systems. Second, we survey existing research to address these threats. Finally, we present our solutions to address the two leading reasons for erroneous and misleading values produced by reputation systems today, i.e., user collusion and short-lived online identities.

Trends in the oil and gas industry to improve safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impact suggest the use of industrial robotics. New developments in regions difficult or dangerous for humans to work in could be enabled with maintenance, inspection and repairs carried out by remotely-controlled industrial robots. This new application area highlights some difficulties with today's robots, as they do not adapt well to dynamic environments, do not offer rich human-robot interaction and are not simple for end-users to program. In addition, the oil and gas context presents a challenging work environment for robots as they are exposed to variable and often extreme weather and need to be safe for use alongside explosive hydrocarbons. As robots are introduced, issues of trust and accountability come to the fore as well as how they fit into organisational structures. If robots have too little autonomy, human operators will waste time attending to robots instead of attending to their work tasks. If robots are highly autonomous, situational awareness of plant activity is diminished. A balance needs to be struck to find a level of autonomy suitable for the task, the realistic capabilities of the automation, and the need to actively engage human operators in a constructive fashion. These issues also relate to what form the interface takes for remote or co-located robot control, as well as how information and activity is represented for remote operators.

Many of the existing computational grid environments use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and X.509 digital certificates as a corner stone for their security architectures. However, security solutions based on PKI have to be usable to be effective otherwise they will not provide the intended protection. This paper presents the Audited Credential Delegation (ACD), a user-centric security identity management solution that accommodates users and resource providers security requirements including authentication, authorisation and auditing security goals from the design level. The proposed architecture removes any association between users and digital certificates, which is the source of the grid usability problem, while addressing resource providers concerns with regards to accountability. A prototype of this architecture has been implemented in Java and Web Services technologies using the recommendations of the Open Web Application Security consortium (OWASP) for developing secure software.

HIPAA has also established principles for security standards that global e-health industry tends to follow. In this paper, a hybrid public key infrastructure solution (HPKI) is proposed to comply with the HIPAA regulations. The main contribution is the new e-health security architecture that is contract oriented instead of session oriented which exists in most literatures. The proposed HPKI has delegated the trust and security management to the medical service provider during the contract period, which is more realistic. It is much an analogy to existing paper based health care systems in terms of functional structure. The cryptographically strong PKI scheme is deployed for the mutual authentication and the distribution of sensitive yet computational non-intensive data while efficient symmetric cryptographic technology is used for the storage and transmission of high volume of medical data such as medical images. One advantage is that the proposed HPKI can be constructed from existing cryptographic technologies where various relevant security standards, tools and products are available.

This paper reports results of our investigation into the efficacy of realtime feedback as a mechanism for incorporating these features of social translucence in location-sharing applications, in order to help users make better privacy decisions. We explored the role of real-time feedback in the context of Buddy Tracker, a mobile location-sharing application. Our work focuses on ways in which real-time feedback affects people's behaviour in order to identify the main criteria for acceptance of this technology. Based on the data from a three week field trial of Buddy Tracker, a focus group session, and interviews, we found that when using a system that provided real-time feedback, people were more accountable for their actions and reduced the number of unreasonable location requests.

Such capabilities often utilize network provenance - the ability to issue queries over network meta-data. For example, network provenance may be used to trace the path a message traverses on the network as well as to determine how message data were derived and which parties were involved in its derivation. This paper presents the design and implementation of ExSPAN, a generic and extensible framework that achieves efficient network provenance in a distributed environment. We utilize the database notion of data provenance to ""explain"" the existence of any network state, providing a versatile mechanism for network provenance. To achieve such flexibility at Internet-scale, ExSPAN uses declarative networking in which network protocols can be modeled as continuous queries over distributed streams and specified concisely in a declarative query language. We extend existing data models for provenance developed in database literature to enable distribution at Internet-scale, and investigate numerous optimization techniques to maintain and query distributed network provenance efficiently. The ExSPAN prototype is developed using RapidNet, a declarative networking platform based on the emerging ns-3 toolkit. Experiments over a simulated network and an actual deployment in a testbed environment demonstrate that our system supports a wide range of distributed provenance computations efficiently, resulting in significant reductions in bandwidth costs compared to traditional approaches. © 2010 ACM.",declarative networking; distributed query processing; provenance,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954746819

Disclosures of sensitive information such as emotional problems, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and genetic predispositions to diseases-could cause embarrassment and affect insurability, child custody cases, and employment. A recent survey by IDC found that ""Most consumers were uncomfortable with their health plan sharing health information with a hospital, a specialist or their primary care doctor (and) were concerned with who saw their information and were worried that the information could be made available online (and) other respondents said they didn't trust their health plan or hospital to protect their information."" Clearly, patients (consumers) feel that it is critical that their medical information is held in confidence. If patients do not feel that their personal medical information will be kept confidential, they may withhold important medical information from health care providers making it difficult to provide quality and effective health care. This issue of safeguarding sensitive patient information has become even more critical given that the Electronic Protected Health Information (PHI), in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), may consist of a patient's medical, demographic and insurance information. Thus, presenting a significant information assurance and security challenge to the health care industry as reflected by the consumers' concerns related to building trust with health care community. If the health care industry falls behind in assuring the public that it can indeed safeguard patient information, then the initiative to create a more efficient and cost effective health care system by using Information Technology will be in serious jeopardy. The research presented in this article addresses this important information assurance and security challenge by building upon past research and presenting a framework of Information Assurance and Compliance developed through multi-site case study approach involving multiple health care providers in the U.S. Mercuri correctly identified that ""solutions (to the information assurance challenge) are not as simple as adding on security tools and providing employees with policies and procedures for their job classification and requiring them to read and sign off on them."" Information Assurance (IA) technologies such as encryption, password protection, access control mechanisms, and so on, for PHI may not be sufficient, since not all individual health care professionals may be familiar with the requirements of the law nor sufficiently motivated or trained to protect private and sensitive patient information. Health care Information Assurance policy (IA Policy) may be in place due to HIPPA requirements, but if health care employees fail to comply with such policy then patient information will be at a risk for disclosure. In this context, Mercuri correctly underscores the importance of human and management factors related to compliance by stating that ""the workers (must be given) a sufficient period in which to incorporate the new structures and rules into their culture and ethics. Otherwise efforts (related to IA Policy compliance) may be frustrated and unsuccessful."" Even though human and management factors, related to compliance, have been recognized as important as technical factors in providing security to PHI in the health care industry, there is a lack of well-developed framework to understand IA policy compliance factors addressing the behavioral dimension in the context of patient health care information. Without such a framework, it is difficult to develop both managerial interventions and research studies in this important area of health care information assurance. The purpose of this research (using multi-site case research approach) is to present such a research framework that examines what factors affect health care employee's behavior to comply with information assurance (IA) policy related to protection of patient health care information. We also present sample measures to assess individual compliance. In the light of recent breaches and/ or theft of sensitive consumer data from banking, academic institutions, government agencies, and health care providers, this study provides a framework that can be extended and adapted to understand IA Policy issues in health care as well as in other industries. Therefore, the implication of this study is much broader and can be extended to other industries with appropriate adaptation. The unifying foundation for our research framework is the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA posits that external factors affect beliefs and beliefs in turn affect attitudes, and attitudes affect intention which ultimately affect one's behavior. We examine how these concepts are related to one's behavior in complying with information assurance policy regarding patient health information. Using TRA, we build our framework on solid theoretical foundations drawing from research in technology acceptance model, information assurance and security, ethical behavior, organizational culture4 and health information management. © 2010 ACM.",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649269553

Every user is therefore required to have a different login-password combination for each online service, or even different credentials for different roles within a service. As a result users tend to make poor password choices that are easy to remember, or even repeat the same login-password information for different services. This poses security threats to service providers and a privacy risk for end-users. The solution is to shift to identity management systems. Such a system will issue a digital identity for every user and will be able to control the full life-cycle of these identities, from creation to termination. A significant advantage of such a system is the single sign-on mechanism, whereby a single action of user authentication and authorization can permit the user to access multiple services without the need to execute any local authentication procedure. We first evaluate existing identity management implementations and then proceed to propose our own solution. Our Identity Management Infrastructure (IMI) differs from similar approaches. We propose a global scale deployment and we address problems that arise from such a design. Another difference is that our technique sets up the end-user as the sole holder of his/her identity information. This prevents the existence of a single point where multiple digital identities are held, which could become a target for potential attackers. The benefits (as seen from our approach) are improved security, accountability, reduced administration costs, ease of deployment and privacy protection. We provide accountability to digital identity holders, while allowing the user to remain anonymous and give service providers and end-users strong security guarantees about the security aspects of our approach. We finally study the security risks involved in our approach and how we address them. © 2010 CRL Publishing Ltd.",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949829779

When a business implements and maintains a strong security posture, it can take advantage of numerous benefits. An organization that can demonstrate an infrastructure protected by robust security mechanisms can potentially see a reduction in insurance premiums being paid. A secure organization can use its security program as a marketing tool, demonstrating to clients that it values their business so much that it takes a very aggressive stance on protecting their information. Security breaches can cost an organization significantly through a tarnished reputation, lost business, and legal fees. Numerous regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, require businesses to maintain the security of information. Security, by its very nature, is inconvenient, and the more robust the security mechanisms, the more inconvenient the process becomes. Most security mechanisms, from passwords to multifactor authentication, are seen as roadblocks to productivity. Despite the benefits of maintaining a secure organization and the potentially devastating consequences of not doing so, many organizations have poor security mechanisms, implementations, policies, and culture. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

To further address the concern of user access privacy, privacy-aware ABE schemes are being developed to achieve hidden access policy recently. For the purpose of secure access control, there is, however, still one critical functionality missing in the existing ABE schemes, which is user accountability. Currently, no ABE scheme can completely prevent the problem of illegal key sharing among users. In this paper, we tackle this problem by firstly proposing the notion of accountable, anonymous, and ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-A3BE, in short) and then giving out a concrete construction. We start by improving the state-of-the-art of anonymous CP-ABE to obtain shorter public parameters and ciphertext length. In the proposed CP-A3BE construction, user accountability can be achieved in black-box model by embedding additional user-specific information into the attribute private key issued to that user, while still maintaining hidden access policy.

In such a scenario, digital identity management (DIM) technology is fundamental in customizing user experience, protecting privacy, underpinning accountability in business transactions, and in complying with regulatory controls. Users identity consists of data, referred to as identity attributes, that encode relevant-security properties of the clients. However, identity attributes can be target of several attacks: the loss or theft of mobile devices results in a exposure of identity attributes; identity attributes that are send over WI-FI or 3G networks can be easily intercepted; identity attributes can also be captured via Bluetooth connections without the user's consent; and mobile viruses, worms and Trojan horses can access the identity attributes stored on mobile devices if this information is not protected by passwords or PIN numbers. Therefore, assuring privacy and security of identity attributes, as well as of any sensitive information stored on mobile devices is crucial. In this paper we address such problems by proposing an approach to manage user identity attributes by assuring their privacy-preserving usage. The approach is based on the concept of privacy preserving multi-factor authentication achieved by a new cryptographic primitive which uses aggregate signatures on commitments that are then used for aggregate zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPK) protocols. We present the implementation of such approach on Nokia NFC cellular phones and report performance evaluation results. © 2009 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.",Digital identity management; Identity attributes; Mobile devices; Privacy,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651555609

Consequently, the weak points in system security are identified. A stochastic model using measurable values to describe the information system security of a SCM is introduced. Information security is a crucial and integral part of the network of supply chains. Each chain or driver requires a different security level according to the services it contributes to the overall SCM system. Different probabilistic weights are assigned to the four goals CIAA of security depending on the SCM driver's mission. A Semi-Markov chain model is used to describe the probabilistic nature of different security levels for each driver in the system. A comparison of the steady-state security for a multi-driver model with different levels of attack is performed, and the results analyzed. Enhanced supply chain security could be achieved by identifying the effects of attacks on the security goals of an organization. The use of this model helps to identify weak points in supply chain system security, and offers hints on how to strengthen them. The model is tested by considering intrusion scenarios representing different levels of attack on the SCM system. An analysis of the results is performed using an interactive application.

Often, websites hosting these activities ask for personal information such as name, e-mail, street address, and phone number. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998 was enacted in reaction to the widespread collection of information from children and subsequent abuses identified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). COPPA is aimed at protecting a child's privacy by requiring parental consent before collecting information from children under 13. In this paper, we describe an automated tool for protecting child privacy called Parental Online Consent for Kids Electronic Transaction (or POCKET). The POCKET framework is a novel, technically feasible and legally sound solution to automatically enforce COPPA. Parents answer a simple questionnaire regarding their privacy requirements and the POCKET user agent automatically converts it into a privacy preferences file. These preferences are enforced when a child uses the Internet. Only websites that adhere to the preferences can receive the child s information, while websites whose policies do not match are blocked. A merchant-specific privacy information package and a signed digital agreement are uploaded to the qualified merchant from the client (child's machine). POCKET framework incorporates a secure handshake protocol to protect the data exchange between the client and the merchant. A local log file created by POCKET and the digital agreement are used to enforce merchant accountability.",Children's privacy; COPPA; Verifiable parental consent,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-62749175223

In this systematic review investigations, presenting quantitative data about data quality and protocol compliance in clinical trials, are analyzed. The results are discussed taking into account the quality assurance procedures implemented. Based on a systematic MEDLINE retrieval, 21 studies [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] could be identified in which data and process quality in clinical trials were investigated and assessed by site visits with source data verification or review of copied source data in the study center and quantitative information about data quality and protocol compliance was available. The majority of investigations were performed by three organizations: European Organization for Research and Treatment of - Cancer (EORTC) (n=7), National Cancer Institute (NCI) (n=7) and investigations of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) (n=4). In addition three investigations of other study groups were identified. The investigations were published between 1981 and 2003. In the majority of cases oncological trials were investigated (n=19) with a focus on radiotherapy trials (n=8). In the EORTC-trials an overall good data quality was assessed (80-90% correct data). Singular problems were found with respect to protocol compliance and reporting of adverse reactions and serious unexpected events. Good quality was also observed with respect to the correct inclusion of patients into trials. By the NCI a standardized audit system was introduced and implemented within cooperative study groups. In the context of these audits different criteria were assessed and a good data quality and protocol compliance measured. Deficits occurred in about 5% of the cases with respect to informed consent, correct application of inclusion criteria, protocol compliance, assessment of outcome criteria, assessment of toxicity, adequate data reporting and data verification. In some investigations problems with treatment compliance (10-20%), drug dose deviations (10%) and drug accountability (15%) were identified. By the TROG a quality assurance procedure was implemented, based on central monitoring of copied source data. By this approach major problems with protocol compliance could be reduced to less than 10% together with a good data quality with an error rate under 5%. The correct handling of in- and exclusion criteria was a problem in individual cases. In summary we found out that good data quality and good to moderate protocol compliance were reported by the study groups that are included in the systematic review. Due to the authors this is mainly due to an established quality assurance system, taking into consideration that audits itself may be an influential factor. Generally, minor problems were observed with respect to informed consent, correct handling of in- and exclusion criteria and data quality, however, in some studies there were problems with protocol compliance. Overall, number and type of deficits depend on study type, quality management and organization of the study group. Fraud was detected only in very few cases. The available evidence refers mainly to established study groups; for data quality and protocol compliance outside these groups only few information is available. However, it should be taken into consideration, that the analysis was performed, at least partly, by the study groups themselves and is not based on independent audits (e.g. external audits). The analysis cannot answer the question whether the results would have been replicable if a strict review according to criteria of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) would have been performed. From the systematic review consequences have to be taken for planning a prospective controlled trial comparing different monitoring strategies. The main influence factor for data quality and protocol compliance in a clinical trial is the quality management system. Quality management covers several other measures apart from monitoring. In order to assess monitoring strategies, all quality assurance procedures within a clinical trial have to be taken into consideration. For the comparison of different monitoring strategies adequate outcome parameter have to be defined (e.g. severe deficits with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria, safety). The analysis indicates that with good quality management and no extensive on-site monitoring severe errors were detected only at relative low frequency. It could well be that with an efficient quality management system differences between monitoring strategies would be small. In order to demonstrate statistical equivalence of monitoring strategies, only small differences can be accepted which again leads to consequences for the sample-size calculation. In addition, it must be taken into consideration that within a controlled trial an independent audit is necessary to assess the effect of different monitoring strategies on the safety of patients and the quality of data. Audits however may be a possible influence factor for data quality and protocol compliance and may complicate the evaluation of the benefit of a monitoring strategy. © 2008 Ohmann et al.",Clinical trial; Data quality; Protocol compliance; Systematic review,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-77149128826

Further, accountability using best practice is essential to defensible governance. Information governance is a major aspect of governance and in turn, security is a major aspect of information governance. Implementing effective security is often difficult for those who are not security aware or trained. Whilst this poses serious risk for business, it is potentially graver for the custodians of personal medical information such as general medical practices. Research has shown that there exist severe deficiencies in information security in general medical practices, whose primary concern is the welfare and treatment of patients and not the security of the information systems. Although technological solutions are plentiful, it is the lack of awareness, non-acceptance of risk and lack oif suitable protection that pose the greatest insecurity. Methods for improving recognition of the need for security and its effective implementation, essentially a cultural shift in thinking about security, are necessary if information governance is to be fulfilled. In general medical practice, clinical governance is a becoming a fundamental aspect of medical practice even though it is a relatively modern concept. The objectives of clinical governance are to enhance the quality of healthcare by employing evidence-based decision making to improve standards of care, outcomes and cost-efficiency. Thus, monitoring and providing evidence of process and resultant improvement must be utilised supported by governance plans. In essence, clinical governance is a vehicle for promoting a cultural shift to a more cost-efficient and responsible service environment for medical practice. Therefore it is worthwhile exploring if an improvement in medical information security can be achieved using parallels with clinical governance term. These terms are already accepted by the medical profession. This theoretical investigation compares the objectives and use of governance in clinical and information applications. Further, it suggests that using a model analogous to clinical governance for information governance may provide a better method for sustained improvement in medical information security practice. Information governance plans would provide explicit evidence of attempts at quality improvement which is a cornerstone of meeting governance requirements. As information governance becomes a driving force for accountability in medical practices, methods to support this will be paramount. A clinical governance approach would benefit medical practices by providing them with a definable model for information security governance using a contextually acceptable paradigm. Further, the adaptation of an environment specific model would indicate how security, and thus the security profession, can provide pragmatic and practical assistance to those professions and organisations who do not retain security trained personnel.",Clinical governance; Information governance; Information security; Medical information security,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873167569

Through the 1990's and 2000's RBAC achieved remarkable success, and today is widely practised the preferred form of access control. Adoption of the 2004 NIST/ANSI Standard RBAC Model [1] marks a maturity concept and practice. The essential roots of this standard go back to the RBAC96 model [2] While numerous enhancements and extensions of RBAC96 and related models have been proposed, the core ideas introduced in RBAC96 have proved to be notably stable and robust. RBAC96 was based on four principles, viz. abstract privileges, separation of administrative functions, least privilege and separation of duties. Advances in RBAC require reconsideration of founding principles. In this paper we offer five founding principles for next-generation access control including next-generation RBAC, summarized as ASCAA for Abstraction, Separation, Containment, Automation and Accountability. Abstraction (i.e., abstract privileges) and separation (i.e., separation of administrative functions) are essentially retained from RBAC96. A generalized principle called containment is introduced, to subsume least privilege, separation of duties and other constraints, as well as modern techniques such as usage and rate limits [3], [4] Next two new principles called automation and accountability are introduced. Automation covers automated acquisition of privileges as well as automated revocation. Traditional RBAC typically requires that user-role and permission-role assignment and revocation result from explicit actions of appropriately authorized administrators. Some aspects of automated user-role assignment [5],[6], [7] and user-role revocation [8] have been previously proposed. We elevate the notion of automation to a full-blown principle and specifically propose self-assignment of roles as a new element. Automating assignment and revocation enables agile lightweight systems by eliminating repeated human intervention. Crucially, of course, we want to do this without compromising security. Accountability has recently received considerable attention driven by emerging requirements of secure information sharing and continued recognition of the insider threat. We offer paradigm of adjustment as a means to achieve accountability. Adjustment acknowledges that not all authorized actions are same. Sensitive operations require an enhanced level of auditing, notification or authentication. For example, it is common place for websites to require additional authentication and notification for sensitive operations such as change of address. While we believe these five ASCAA principles (Abstraction, Separation, Containment, Automation and Accountability) are relevant to access control systems in general, the discussion this paper is limited to their application to RBAC.",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-49049096543

However, existing systems assume a client-server architecture in which only the clients, but not the servers, care about their privacy. In peer-to-peer (P2P) systems where both clients and servers are peer users with privacy concerns, no existing system correctly strikes that balance between privacy and accountability. In this paper, we provide this missing piece: a credential system in which peers are pseudonymous to one another (that is, two who interact more than once can recognize each other via pseudonyms) but are otherwise anonymous and unlinkable across different peers. Such a credential system finds applications in, e.g., Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANets) and P2P networks. We formalize the security requirements of our proposed credential system, provide a construction for it, and prove the security of our construction.

At present it lags far behind most other industries in its use of modern information technology to help address these pressures. In many countries governments are making substantial investments in clinical information systems to support the acute (hospital) sector, yet over 90 percent of patient encounters occur in the General (Family) Practitioner's office. Numerous studies have shown that the vast majority of physicians' offices in North America still use paper charts, and from this perspective little has changed from the 19th century. Health information technology, including the Internet, unites three powerful tools for improving medical practice: knowledge management for clinical decision support, secure communications for web messaging, and remote care (telehealth). The physician's office is the heart of patient care, and therefore, a critical area for improving efficiency, the quality of care, and accountability of the system. This study includes: A review of the literature; an overview of the drivers for change; observations from key informant physicians and medical students; and the results of interviews and a focus group identifying specific technologies that will likely be in common use in physicians' offices by 2016.

For example, an operational excellence management system provides standardized guidelines and practices to enable continuous improvement of the organization's operational risk mitigation competence. The simplest frameworks include the ability to execute - ""Plan, Do, Check, Act."" A more complete management system would include accountability and a schedule for activities to be completed, as well as auditing tools to implement corrective actions in addition to scheduled activities, creating an upward spiral of continuous improvement facilitating operational risk management across the enterprise. As a startup drilling contractor, implementing a management system and defining a corporate culture can be a daunting task. Part of the culture that must be nurtured is an environment of accountability. One such contractor, hereafter known as the ""Company"" employed a preferred practice enterprise risk management tool already utilized by many major operators. The idea is simple; develop a culture of accountability by using proven business processes already employed by many major operators. Starting with a small scope of functionality using incident reporting and action item tracking, this Company has formed the backbone of a true accountability system. With initial success in tracking closure of action items, the Company is now posed to expand the tool with dedicated modules to govern other processes within the management system including: Management of Change Training Requests Audit/Assessment Module High Value Learning Events Behavior Based Safety Observations Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Metrics Many companies use different software technology toolsets to strengthen their execution of various management system processes with the goal to reduce costs incurred from loss events (injuries, spills, asset damage, operation shut-downs, etc.) on a global scale. A successful management system framework should enable transparency and accountability across all facets of the organization using centralized tools. Many of these management systems have similarities and a common intent. However, often the case is management systems exist in the form of three-ring binders that sit on the shelf and therefore scarcely reflect the realities of how business is run in the field.

The method can be used for accurate identification of neutron sources such as Cf-252, Am-Be, and Am-Li. AU these sources were investigated in combination with several shielding blocks made of polyethylene and lead. From the results it is apparent that source identification is possible by the data inspection of the measured pulse-height distributions. The general slope of the distributions can be used for the source identification, and all sources tested can be accurately identified. All measured pulse-height distributions were also compared to distributions simulated with the MCNP-PoliMi code and very good agreement was achieved. © 2007 IEEE.",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-48349101037

We observe that blind signatures have potential to form critical building blocks of network security protocols, where an authority needs to vouch for the legitimacy of a message but there is also a need to keep the ownership of the message secret from the authority. Different forms of blind signature constructions exist in the literature and have found valuable use in areas such E-Cash technology and E-voting schemes. However, conventional blind signatures are quite heavyweight and thus, a direct application of these traditional signatures face scalability and performance challenges. In this paper, we present a novel third-order linear feedback shift register (LFSR) sequence-based, 2-party signature scheme, EGCLFSR, following a well-known variant of the generalized ElGamal signature scheme. Using EGCLFSR, and following fundamentals of a well known blind signature, originally used for E-Cash systems, we present an efficient blind signature BCLFSR (also the first blind signature based on LFSR sequences), which can serve as a protocol building block for privacy-preserving accountability systems. We perform a theoretical analysis including correctness and security of BCLFSR and also present a performance (computation and communication costs, storage overhead) comparison of the proposed scheme with well-known traditional constructions.",Accountability; Blind signature; Cubic LFSR-based cryptosystems; ElGamal signature; GH; LFSR sequence; Privacy-preserving accountability; XTR,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-47249104770

An important motivation for such systems is self-scaling. That is, increased participation increases the capacity of the system. Unfortunately, this property is at risk from selfish participants. The decentralized nature of peer-to-peer systems makes accounting difficult. We show that e-cash can be a practical solution to the desire for accountability in peer-to-peer systems while maintaining their ability to self-scale. No less important, e-cash is a natural fit for peer-to-peer systems that attempt to provide (or preserve) privacy for their participants. We show that e-cash can be used to provide accountability without compromising the existing privacy goals of a peer-to-peer system. We show how e-cash can be practically applied to a file sharing application. Our approach includes a set of novel cryptographic protocols that mitigate the computational and communication costs of anonymous e-cash transactions, and system design choices that further reduce overhead and distribute load.

Every user is therefore required to have a different login-password combination for each online service, or even different credentials for different roles within a service. As a result users tend to make poor password choices that are easy to remember, or even repeat the same login-password information for different services. This poses security threats to service providers and a privacy risk for end-users. The solution is to shift to identity management systems. Such a system will issue a digital identity for every user and will be able to control the full life-cycle of these identities, from creation to termination. A significant advantage of such a system is the single sign-on mechanism, whereby a single action of user authentication and authorization can permit the user to access multiple services without the need to execute any local authentication procedure. We first evaluate existing identity management implementations and then proceed to propose our own solution. Our Identity Management Infrastructure (IMI) differs from similar approaches. We propose a global scale deployment and we address problems that arise from such a design. Another difference is that our technique sets up the end-user as the sole holder of his/her identity information. This prevents the existence of a single point where multiple digital identities are held, which could become a target for potential attackers. The benefits (as seen from our approach) are improved security, accountability, reduced administration costs, ease of deployment and privacy protection. We provide accountability to digital identity holders, while allowing the user to remain anonymous and give service providers and end-users strong security guarantees about the security aspects of our approach. We finally study the security risks involved in our approach and how we address them. © 2007 CRL Publishing Ltd.",,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-38949109589

It is vitally important but extremely challenging to fight such unwanted traffic. We need a series of defensive mechanisms to identify unwanted packets, filter them out, and further defeat their associated attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, scalable packet authentication mechanism, named Lightweight Internet Permit System (LIPS), as a first line of defense to effectively filter out the most common forms of unwanted traffic, spoofed and unsolicited packets, such that in-depth security schemes can take care of the remaining issues more efficiently. LIPS is a simple extension of IP, in which each packet carries an access permit issued by its destination host or gateway, and the destination verifies the access permit to determine to accept or drop the packet. LIPS provides preliminary traffic-origin accountability that supports two salient features to confine unwanted traffic: (1) filter out the most common forms of unwanted packets and defeat associated attacks; (2) help us identify compromised hosts/domains such that we are able to build active defense schemes to deal with various attacks through real-time inter-domain collaboration. In this paper, we first present the design and prototype implementation of LIPS on Linux 2.4 kernel, and then use analysis, simulations, and experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of LIPS in protecting critical resources with light overheads. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Until recently, most PACS users have had limited access to auditing information. Access required resources to handle manual inspection of audit logs, and access to proprietary databases was not always available. Some vendors now produce eXtensible Markup Language (XML) audit logs based on certain events occurring in PACS. However, it is up to the user to convert this information into an easily mined data repository supporting compliance and quality control. This process can be handled in multiple ways, which could mean different audit mechanisms depending on the PACS (or other hospital system) used. It is apparent that an organized method of dealing with audit information is needed. This help may be provided within the Integrating the Healthcare Environment (IHE) framework. The IHE initiative defines a set of profiles, actors, and transactions that create common scenarios for particular workflow processes. The Integration Profiles depict security as a fundamental requirement of the framework. Specifically, the Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA) profile defines standards based mechanisms for securely transmitting and storing audit records in a central repository.

Peltier believes the whole computer investigation field needs to be rethought due to the emergence of anti-forensics. He also says we have not seen the worst of DDoS attacks yet, and predicts a resurgence. Peltier foretells a rise in the use of CD-based firewalls making firewalls more resistant to threats that exploit configuration. Infidel CEO Becky Bace believes suppliers watch helplessly as attackers move up the application stack, and fail to keep up with countermeasures. She predicts classic antivirus and worm defences are on their way out to be overtaken by better solutions. Keith Rhodes of the US General Accountability Office thinks the trend of developers not writing code leads to sloppiness in software. And independent consultant Rik Farrow is highly sceptical of Microsoft's inroads into the antivirus market. Richard Power and Dario Forte organize an expert roundtable to answer three big questions about attacks and countermeasures in the past, present and future. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides access control requirements, the availability of services in many applications often further imposes obligation requirements, which specify what actions have to be taken by a subject in the future as a condition of getting certain privileges at present. However, it is not clear yet what the implications of obligation policies are concerning the security goals of a system.In this paper, we propose a formal metamodel that captures the key aspects of a system that are relevant to obligation management. We formally investigate the interpretation of security policies from the perspective of obligations, and define secure system states based on the concept of accountability. We also study the complexity of checking a state's accountability under different assumptions about a system. Copyright 2006 ACM.",Obligations; Policy,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547346853

For some applications, it is desirable to set a limit on the dollar amounts of anonymous transactions. For example, governments require that large transactions be reported for tax purposes: In this work, we present the first e-cash system that makes this possible without a trusted party. In our system, a user's anonymity is guaranteed so long as she does not: (1) double-spend a coin, or (2) exceed the publicly-known spending limit with any merchant. The spending limit may vary with the merchant. Violation of either condition can be detected, and can (optionally) lead to identification of the user and discovery of her other activities. While it is possible to balance accountability and privacy this way using e-cash, this is impossible to do using regular cash. Our scheme is based on our recent compact e-cash system. It is secure under the same complexity assumptions in the random-oracle model. We inherit its efficiency: 2 ℓ coins can be stored in O(ℓ + k) bits and the complexity of the withdrawal and spend protocols is O(ℓ + k), where k is the security parameter. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750024803

One approach to addressing this mandate is by utilizing user access control and generating audit trails of the various authorized as well as unauthorized user access of health data. Although most current clinical image systems [e.g., picture archiving and communication system (PACS)] have components that generate log files for application debugging purposes, there is a lack of methodology to obtain and synthesize the pertinent data from the large volumes of log data generated by these multiple components within a PACS. We have designed a HIPAA-compliant architecture specifically for tracking and auditing the image workflow of clinical imaging systems such as PACS. As an initial first step, we developed HIPAA-compliant auditing system (H-CAS) based on parts of this HIPAA-compliant architecture. H-CAS was implemented within a test-bed PACS simulator located in the Image Processing and Informatics lab at the University of Southern California. Evaluation scenarios were developed where different user types performed legal and illegal access of PACS image data within each of the different components in the PACS simulator. Results were based on whether the scenarios of unauthorized access were correctly identified and documented as well as on normal operational activity. Integration and implementation pitfalls were also noted and included.

Grid Computing System (GCS) is a distributed system infrastructure over which distributed applications with crossorganization resource sharing are operated. Grid applications are modelled by the notion of virtual organization which is generally composed of participants from different organizations driven by specific tasks. In order to control participation and access to shared resource, authorization is essential in VO. Authorization in VO is challenging because of the dynamic and distributed nature of VO. A community authorization service (GAS) was proposed recently to meet the Grid challenges and to enforce fine-grained access control policies in the VO. However, the situation is aggravated when VO is used to model business application systems such as financial systems of commercial enterprises where security and accountability are of key concerns. The emphasis on separation of duties in business applications only make things worse. This paper aims to address these authorization issues when the GCS is used to support business applications. In this paper, we introduce the use of threshold closure as a tool for enhancing the GAS in order for the Grid to better support commercial VO. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",Authorization service; Grid organization tools; Virtual organization,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-35048875350

This sharing, coupled with the need to execute untrusted code from arbitrary users, introduces security hazards. Grid environments are built on top of platforms that control access to resources within a single administrative domain, at the granularity of a user. In wide-area multidomain grid environments, the overhead of maintaining user accounts is prohibitive, and securing access to resources via user accountability is impractical. Typically, these issues are handled by implementing checks that guarantee the safety of applications, so that they can run in shared user accounts. This work shows that safety checks - language-based, compile-time, link-time or load-time - currently implemented in most grid environments are either inadequate or limit allowed grid users and applications. A survey of various grid systems is presented, highlighting the problems and limitations of current grid environments. A runtime process monitoring technique is also proposed. The approach allows setting-up an execution environment that supports the full legitimate use allowed by the security policy of a shared resource. For shell-based applications, performance measurements of the proposed scheme show up to 2.14 times less overheads as compared to the case where all applications including the shell are monitored. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Mandates for ensuring health data security have been issued by the federal government such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), where healthcare institutions are obliged to take appropriate measures to ensure that patient information is only provided to people who have a professional need. Guidelines, such as digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) standards that deal with security issues, continue to be published by organizing bodies in healthcare. However, there are many differences in implementation especially for an integrated system like picture archiving and communication system (PACS), and the infrastructure to deploy these security standards is often lacking. Over the past 6 years, members in the Image Processing and Informatics Laboratory, Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles/University of Southern California, have actively researched image security issues related to PACS and teleradiology. The paper summarizes our previous work and presents an approach to further research on the digital envelope (DE) concept that provides image integrity and security assurance in addition to conventional network security protection. The DE, including the digital signature (DS) of the image as well as encrypted patient information from the DICOM image header, can be embedded in the background area of the image as an invisible permanent watermark. The paper outlines the systematic development, evaluation and deployment of the DE method in a PACS environment. We have also proposed a dedicated PACS security server that will act as an image authority to check and certify the image origin and integrity upon request by a user, and meanwhile act also as a secure DICOM gateway to the outside connections and a PACS operation monitor for HIPAA supporting information. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We argue that full anonymity may present a security risk that is unacceptable in certain applications; therefore, anonymity and accountability are both needed. To resolve the inherent contradiction between anonymity and accountability in a flexible manner, we introduce the concepts of internal and external accountabilities. Intuitively, internal accountability applies to virtual users only, and is governed by the policy of a group (a community). In contrast, external accountability is needed to address issues related to misuse if the activity is to be penalized in real life according to internal rules or external laws. We provide a set of protocols to ensure that users' virtual and real identities cannot be disclosed unnecessarily, and allow users to monitor the data collected about them as well as to terminate their membership (both real and virtual) under certain conditions. We develop a general conceptual model of electronic Editorial Board (e-EB). In our thinking, there are deep connections between anonymity and self-organization. In turn, the concept of self-organizing e-EB (SO-eEB) is introduced here, and a robotic example is provided. Finally, SO-eEB is specialized to Anonymous and Accountable Self-Organizing Communities (A2SOCs), that fully supports internal and external accountability while providing anonymity.",Accountability; Anonymity; Authentication; Privacy; Self-organizing community,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037697335

The aim of such tools is to assist individuals to sift through the mountains of information available so as to be better able to discern valid and reliable messages from those which are misleading or inaccurate. Objective: Recognising that European citizens are avid consumers of health related information on the internet and recognising that they are already using the types of rating system described above, the European Council at Feira on June 19-20 2000 supported an initiative within eEurope 2002 to develop a core set of Quality Criteria for Health Related Websites. The specific aim was to draw up a commonly agreed set of simple quality criteria on which Member States, as well as public and private bodies, may draw in the development of quality initiatives for health related websites. These criteria should be applied in addition to relevant Community law. Methods: A meeting was held during 2001 which drew together key players from Government departments, International Organisations, non-governmental organisations and industry, to explore current practices and experiments in this field. Some sixty invited participants from all the Member States, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States of America took part in the meeting of June 7-8, 2001: they included delegates from industrial, medical, and patient interest groups, delegates from Member States' governments, and key invited speakers from the field of health information ethics. These individuals, and many others, also took part in the web-based consultation which was open from august to November 2001. Results: The broad headings for quality criteria identified include Transparency and Honesty, Authority, Privacy and data protection, Updating of information, Accountability, Responsible partnering, Editorial policy, Accessibility, the latter includes attention to guidelines on physical accessibility as well as general findability, searchability, readability, usability, etc. A metadata labelling system may be used to make health data more findable. Such a system may also be used in conjunction with quality criteria to give higher ranking by search engines to those sites or pages labelled as complying with defined quality criteria. Conclusions: The set of quality criteria is based upon a broad consensus among specialists in this field, health authorities, and prospective users. It is now to be expected that national and regional health authorities, relevant professional associations, and private medical website owners will 1) implement the Quality Criteria for Health Related Websites in a manner appropriate to their website and consumers; 2) develop information campaigns to educate site developers and citizens about minimum quality standards for health related websites; 3) draw on the wide range of health information offered across the European Union and localise such information for the benefit of citizens (translation and cultural adaptation); 4) exchange information and experience at European level about how quality standards are being implemented.","Commerce/standards; Ethics, Professional; Guidelines; Health Care Quality; Health Care/standards; Information Management/standards; Internet/standards; Medical Informatics/standards; Privacy; Quality Assurance; Quality control; Social Control, Formal",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-3242775459

The ability to perform reidentification should be technically bound to the actual existence of a legal purpose, which in some applications can be interpreted as the transgression of a threshold.

Our main contribution is a model for accountable certificate management, where clients receive attestations confirming inclusion/removal of their certificates from the database of valid certificates. We explain why accountability depends on the inability of the third parties to create contradictory attestations. After that we define an undeniable attester as a primitive that provides efficient attestation creation, publishing and verification, so that it is intractable to create contradictory attestations. We introduce authenticated search trees and build an efficient undeniable attester upon them. The proposed system is the first accountable long-term certificate management system. Moreover, authenticated search trees can be used in many security-critical applications instead of the (sorted) hash trees to reduce trust in the authorities, without decrease in efficiency. Therefore, the undeniable attester promises looks like a very useful cryptographic primitive with a wide range of applications.",Accountable certificate management; Attesters; Authenticated search trees; Long-term authenticity; Non-repudiation; Public-key infrastructure; Search trees; Time-stamping,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034449541

This paper describes an implementation of procedures, libraries, and separation of duties to improve security in programming. This implementation helps to limit scope, reveal programmer intent and fix accountability. It assumes and supports such improved programming technologies as top-down design, structured programming, psuedo-code documentation, use of librarians, inspections, and ""walk-throughs"". While the implementation described here will contribute to security, it is not sufficient. Management will wish to consider the application of many other measures. © 1982.","""walk-throughs""; inspections; management control; Program Library; pseudo-code documentation; structured programming; top-down design; use of librarians",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020206582
