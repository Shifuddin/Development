Some contributions have focused on integrating security aspects, mainly access control mechanisms, at the implementation phase. Others pay a particular attention to the capture and analysis of security requirements. However, to our knowledge, no method addresses the whole problem of the specification of security requirements and their transformation through all the phases of the IS development life cycle. We argue that better Secured IS can be obtained if security issues are taken into account at an earlier phase of the system life cycle and integrated with functional aspects along the whole life cycle. This paper is a step forward to a comprehensive security conceptual meta-model encompassing the main security properties such as availability, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability. It integrates functional and non-functional requirements. It includes social, organizational as well as informational aspects. This meta-model is the backbone of our approach.",2011,2015-09-07 07:22:10,2015-09-07 07:22:10,2015-09-07 07:22:10,22–28,,,,,,,SESS '11,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,information system; model driven approach; security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disclosures of sensitive information such as emotional problems, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and genetic predispositions to diseases---could cause embarrassment and affect insurability, child custody cases, and employment. A recent survey by IDC found that ""Most consumers …were uncomfortable with their health plan sharing health information with a hospital, a specialist or their primary care doctor… (and) were concerned with who saw their information and were worried that the information could be made available online… (and) other respondents said they didn't trust their health plan or hospital to protect their information."" Clearly, patients (consumers) feel that it is critical that their medical information is held in confidence. If patients do not feel that their personal medical information will be kept confidential, they may withhold important medical information from health care providers making it difficult to provide quality and effective health care. This issue of safeguarding sensitive patient information has become even more critical given that the Electronic Protected Health Information (PHI), in Electronic Medical Records (EMR) as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), may consist of a patient's medical, demographic and insurance information. Thus, presenting a significant information assurance and security challenge to the health care industry as reflected by the consumers' concerns related to building trust with health care community. If the health care industry falls behind in assuring the public that it can indeed safeguard patient information, then the initiative to create a more efficient and cost effective health care system by using Information Technology will be in serious jeopardy. The research presented in this article addresses this important information assurance and security challenge by building upon past research and presenting a framework of Information Assurance and Compliance developed through multi-site case study approach involving multiple health care providers in the U.S. Mercuri correctly identified that ""solutions (to the information assurance challenge) are not as simple as adding on security tools and providing employees with policies and procedures for their job classification and requiring them to read and sign off on them."" Information Assurance (IA) technologies such as encryption, password protection, access control mechanisms, and so on, for PHI may not be sufficient, since not all individual health care professionals may be familiar with the requirements of the law nor sufficiently motivated or trained to protect private and sensitive patient information. Health care Information Assurance policy (IA Policy) may be in place due to HIPPA requirements, but if health care employees fail to comply with such policy then patient information will be at a risk for disclosure. In this context, Mercuri correctly underscores the importance of human and management factors related to compliance by stating that ""…the workers (must be given) a sufficient period in which to incorporate the new structures and rules into their culture and ethics. Otherwise efforts (related to IA Policy compliance) may be frustrated and unsuccessful."" Even though human and management factors, related to compliance, have been recognized as important as technical factors in providing security to PHI in the health care industry, there is a lack of well-developed framework to understand IA policy compliance factors addressing the behavioral dimension in the context of patient health care information. Without such a framework, it is difficult to develop both managerial interventions and research studies in this important area of health care information assurance. The purpose of this research (using multi-site case research approach) is to present such a research framework that examines what factors affect health care employee's behavior to comply with information assurance (IA) policy related to protection of patient health care information. We also present sample measures to assess individual compliance. In the light of recent breaches and/ or theft of sensitive consumer data from banking, academic institutions, government agencies, and health care providers, this study provides a framework that can be extended and adapted to understand IA Policy issues in health care as well as in other industries. Therefore, the implication of this study is much broader and can be extended to other industries with appropriate adaptation. The unifying foundation for our research framework is the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA posits that external factors affect beliefs and beliefs in turn affect attitudes, and attitudes affect intention which ultimately affect one's behavior. We examine how these concepts are related to one's behavior in complying with information assurance policy regarding patient health information. Using TRA, we build our framework on solid theoretical foundations drawing from research in technology acceptance model, information assurance and security, ethical behavior, organizational culture4 and health information management.",March 2010,2015-09-07 07:19:42,2015-09-07 07:19:42,2015-09-07 07:19:42,126–131,,3,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The popularity of the P2P paradigm prompts the need for specialized security services which makes P2P security an important and challenging research topic. Most prior work in P2P security focused on authentication, key management and secure communication. However, an important pre-requisite for many P2P security services is secure admission, or how one becomes a peer in a P2P setting. This issue has been heretofore largely untouched.This paper builds upon some recent work [11] which constructed a peer group admission control framework based on different policies and corresponding cryptographic techniques. Our central goal is to assess the practicality of these techniques. To this end, we construct and evaluate concrete P2P admission mechanisms based on various cryptographic techniques. Although our analysis focuses primarily on performance, we also consider other important features, such as: anonymity, unlinkability and accountability.

For example, the BGP routing table keeps growing rapidly as the Internet scales up; Source IP address spoofing and prefix hijacking undermine the security of fundamental Internet applications. Motivated by seeking evolvable architecture solutions, we propose an enhanced inter-domain routing architecture to address these problems. In our architecture, we first introduce two routing hierarchies: local routing on specific network layer protocols/addresses and global routing on a coarser granularity in order to improve the routing scalability. The end-to-end routes are composed of local IP-level forwarding and global transit tunnels on higher routing hierarchy. Secondly we propose ""pair-wise"" routing on the coarser granularity which may facilitate source authentication and inter-domain accountability. On the data plane, an inter-domain path is composed of concatenated local transit tunnels within administration boundaries which should comply with corresponding local transit policies. In addition to enhanced scalability, security and accountability, our new routing architecture may facilitate Internet-wide deployment of new network layer protocols and leverage IP evolution in the long run.",2011,2015-09-07 07:25:01,2015-09-07 07:25:01,2015-09-07 07:25:01,140–143,,,,,,,AINTEC '11,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,architecture; inter-domain; internet; routing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We argue that full anonymity may present a security risk that is unacceptable in certain applications; therefore, anonymity and accountability are both needed. To resolve the inherent contradiction between anonymity and accountability in a flexible manner, we introduce the concepts of internal and external accountabilities. Intuitively, internal accountability applies to virtual users only, and is governed by the policy of a group (a community). In contrast, external accountability is needed to address issues related to misuse if the activity is to be penalized in real life according to internal rules or external laws. We provide a set of protocols to ensure that users' virtual and real identities cannot be disclosed unnecessarily, and allow users to monitor the data collected about them as well as to terminate their membership (both real and virtual) under certain conditions. We develop a general conceptual model of electronic Editorial Board (e-EB). In our thinking, there are deep connections between anonymity and self-organization. In turn, the concept of self-organizing e-EB (SO-eEB) is introduced here, and a robotic example is provided.

In this presentation, I examine some of the reasons for this and some of the lessons learned to date. Focus on client-side security is warranted primarily because it is substantially more difficult to achieve than server security in practice, since clients interact with human users directly. I argue that system and application partitioning to meet user security needs is now feasible, and that special focus must be placed on how to design and implement trustworthy communication, not merely secure channels, between system partitions. Two forms of partitioning system and network components are described. The first, which is inspired by Lampson's Red/Green separation idea [1], partitions system resources instead of ""virtualizing"" them, and switches between partitions only under (human) user control exercised via a trusted path. Neither operating systems nor applications can escape their partition or transfer control to other partitions behind the user's back [2] as a consequence of malware or insider attacks. Trustworthy communication among system and network partitions, which can be established only via network communication, goes beyond firewalls, guards and filters. The extent to which one partition accepts input from or outputs to another depends on the accountability of, and trust established with, the input provider and output receiver. It also depends on input-rate throttling and output propagation control, which often require establishing some degree of control over remote communication end points. The second form of partitioning separates programmer-selected, security-sensitive code blocks from untrusted operating system code, applications and devices, and provides strong guarantees of data secrecy and integrity, as well as execution integrity, to an external entity via attestation [3]. Again, the key criterion for the separation and isolation of sensitive code partitions from untrusted code is the ability to establish trustworthy communication between security-sensitive and untrusted code; e.g., the security-sensitive code accepts only input whose validity it can verify in its own partition, and provides output only in areas that are legitimately accessible to untrusted code. The design of security-sensitive code partitions relies on source code analysis for modularity, where module input/output control -- not just security-policy isolation and code size minimization -- is a property of interest. Several applications of security-sensitive code isolation are illustrated.",2010,2015-09-07 07:25:01,2015-09-07 07:25:01,2015-09-07 07:25:01,161–162,,,,,,,SACMAT '10,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,architectures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does the field of ethics provide a viable framework for assessing an evaluating such practices? And are projects that involve students in computing for the social good efficacious in the formation of ethical computing professionals? At Carnegie Mellon, we have developed practices to involve a significant number of students in software development projects and consulting engagements for the social good. A consulting course has had over 500 community service-learning engagements in 18 years, and in a software development capstone course our yearly cohort of 60 students work in small teams to develop software for 15+ social service organizations. Our practices have evolved out of our shared vision of what makes a good computing professional, but we would now like to better define, assess, and communicate what the vision is. The NSF has a program solicitation (15-528) entitled Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM (CCE STEM) that ""funds research projects that identify factors that are efficacious in the formation of ethical STEM researchers in all the fields of science and engineering that NSF supports."" It asks: ""What constitutes ethical STEM research and practice? Which cultural and institutional contexts promote ethical STEM research and practice and why?"" Among the factors they mention are ""curricula ... that stress social responsibility and humanitarian goals""; i.e. computing for the social good. And ""what practices contribute to the establishment and maintenance of ethical cultures and how can these practices be transferred, extended to, and integrated into other research and learning settings?"" To provide some context from my experience, there are two prevalent types of computing-for-the-social-good projects: 1. System-based: Projects that address a social-good (e.g. disaster management, public accountability, or medical record management) and are generally released to the public as open source projects (e.g. Sahana, Ushahidi, or OpenMRS). 2. Client-based: Projects that custom-build a solution for a nonprofit, school, international NGO, or other social-good organization. For example, helping a nonprofit increase fundraising with a website, or a school improve interaction with its students using a course management system. Often, but not always, these solutions use the open source projects in (1), but in all cases the solution involves much more work than fetching the software. Our consulting and capstone project course use the client-based model. When done well, client-based social-good projects have the potential to enrich student learning in ambiguous real world environments. Students report increased confidence, further development of technical skills, a sense of satisfaction and appreciation for the needs of their partner organizations. Delivery of a tangible benefit to partner organizations is also generally an expected outcome. Providing lasting value to community partners should, in practice, be a key objective of any serious client engagement. However too often, the needs, concerns and ultimate outcomes for community partners are often overlooked or forgotten. Solutions that are incomplete, poorly implemented, poorly documented, inappropriate to the problem at hand or simply unsustainable may provide little or no value to community partners. In fact, these solutions may actually be detrimental to partner organizations. There is significant risk, therefore, that benefits to ICT service learning projects are asymmetric; students generally report significant benefits from the experience, but community based partners may, in fact, find the experience expensive, risky, and potentially harmful to their missions, organizations and employees. Many community partners simply do not have the resources to finish incomplete projects, sustain or maintain complex software or systems, or perform needed application or server administration. We use a capacity-building model of working with a community partner. This is not the let-us-buildyou-a-system model, where students develop and drop in (often unsustainable) technology solutions. Rather, it emphasizes working-with, and weaving solutions into the development partner's organization, building their capacity to not only use, but to maintain and evolve their solutions as their needs grow and change. Returning to the bigger question of cultivating a culture of ethical practice, these classes are meant to model an ethic of care in meeting the needs of a nonprofit client whose mission is the social good. They expose students to issues of: - Being truthful in working with the client: not misrepresenting their capabilities nor the robustness of their solution. - Being respectful and not misusing the client's time and other resources. - Not taking advantage of their team mates via slacking and free-loading. - Safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of citizen information in any system they build, and including controls that maintain appropriate privacy and confidentiality. - Not misappropriating software, being aware of licenses, and attributing borrowed work that is otherwise not licensed. - Understanding the role of nonprofit organizations in society. How they are similar and different from for-profit corporations. How they contribute to the social good where markets would not otherwise serve. The NSF solicitation provides an opportunity to support looking at both why we do computing for the social good, and whether these educational practices develop computing professionals who are more aware of the ethical dimensions of their work. The solicitation encourages a comparison across institutions; is SIGCAS a good nexus for building that collaboration? As part of the SIGCAS Symposium, the author shared practices in the consulting and software development capstone courses, and the nascent evaluation ideas they are piloting.

Such capabilities often utilize network provenance - the ability to issue queries over network meta-data. For example, network provenance may be used to trace the path a message traverses on the network as well as to determine how message data were derived and which parties were involved in its derivation. This paper presents the design and implementation of ExSPAN, a generic and extensible framework that achieves efficient network provenance in a distributed environment. We utilize the database notion of data provenance to ""explain"" the existence of any network state, providing a versatile mechanism for network provenance. To achieve such flexibility at Internet-scale, ExSPAN uses declarative networking in which network protocols can be modeled as continuous queries over distributed streams and specified concisely in a declarative query language. We extend existing data models for provenance developed in database literature to enable distribution at Internet-scale, and investigate numerous optimization techniques to maintain and query distributed network provenance efficiently. The ExSPAN prototype is developed using RapidNet, a declarative networking platform based on the emerging ns-3 toolkit. Experiments over a simulated network and an actual deployment in a testbed environment demonstrate that our system supports a wide range of distributed provenance computations efficiently, resulting in significant reductions in bandwidth costs compared to traditional approaches.",2010,2015-09-07 07:22:10,2015-09-07 07:22:10,2015-09-07 07:22:10,615–626,,,,,,,SIGMOD '10,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,declarative networking; distributed query processing; provenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this research is to guide development teams, regulators, and certification bodies by assessing the state of the practice in EHR access control. In this paper, we present a compilation of 25 criteria relative to access control in EHR systems found in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulation, meaningful use certification criteria, best practices embodied in the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) role-based access control standard, and other best practices found in the literature. We then examine the state of the practice in access control by evaluating four open source EHR systems using these 25 evaluation criteria.

This structure raises privacy concerns over the handling of large-scale and at least logically centralized collections of user data. In an effort to protect user privacy and decrease provider dependence, decentralization has been proposed for SNS. This decentralization has effects on availability, opportunities for traffic analysis, resource requirements, cooperation and incenctives, trust and accountability for different entities, and performance. In this paper, we explore the spectrum of SNS implementations from centralized to fully decentralized and several hybrid constellations in between. Taking a systematic approach of SNS layers, decentralization classes, and replication strategies, we investigate the design space and focus on two issues as concrete examples where the contrast of extreme ends of the decentralization spectrum is illustrative, namely potential adversaries and churn-related profile availability.

Due to their central and trusted position in the software ecosystem, coerced, hacked or malicious app markets pose a serious threat to user security. Currently, there is little that hinders a nation state adversary (NSA) or other powerful attackers from using such central and trusted points of software distribution to deploy customized (malicious) versions of apps to specific users. Due to intransparencies in the current app installation paradigm, this kind of attack is extremely hard to detect. In this paper, we evaluate the risks and drawbacks of current app deployment in the face of powerful attackers. We assess the app signing practices of 97% of all free Google Play apps and find that the current practices make targeted attacks unnecessarily easy and almost impossible to detect for users and app developers alike. We show that high profile Android apps employ intransparent and unaccountable strategies when they publish apps to (multiple) alternative markets. We then present and evaluate Application Transparency (AT), a new framework that can defend against ``targeted-and-stealthy'' attacks, mount by malicious markets.  We deployed AT in the wild and conducted an extensive field study in which we analyzed app installations on 253,819 real world Android devices that participate in a popular anti-virus app's telemetry program.

People also engage in subtle negotiation around and appropriation of Facebook's features to accomplish both personal and relational goals.

To ensure the operation and security of Bitcoin, it is essential that all transactions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users. Unavoidably, in such a setting, the security of transactions comes at odds with transaction privacy. Motivated by the fact that transaction confirmation in Bitcoin requires tens of minutes, we analyze the conditions for performing successful double-spending attacks against fast payments in Bitcoin, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of a minute). We show that unless new detection techniques are integrated in the Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with considerable probability and can be mounted at low cost. We propose a new and lightweight countermeasure that enables the detection of double-spending attacks in fast transactions. In light of such misbehavior, accountability becomes crucial. We show that in the specific case of Bitcoin, accountability complements privacy.

Since ABE allows encryption for multiple users with attributes satisfying the same policy, it may not be always possible to associate a decryption key to a particular individual. A misbehaving user could abuse the anonymity by leaking the key to someone else, without worrying of being traced. In this paper, we propose a multi-authority ciphertext-policy (AND gates with wildcard) ABE scheme with accountability, which allows tracing the identity of a misbehaving user who leaked the decryption key to others, and thus reduces the trust assumptions not only on the authorities but also the users.

Because these devices can be linked to the movement of individuals, there is significant danger that the aggregate computation will violate the location privacy of individuals. This paper develops and evaluates PrivStats, a system for computing aggregate statistics over location data that simultaneously achieves two properties: first, provable guarantees on location privacy even in the face of any side information about users known to the server, and second, privacy-preserving accountability (i.e., protection against abusive clients uploading large amounts of spurious data). PrivStats achieves these properties using a new protocol for uploading and aggregating data anonymously as well as an efficient zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol we developed from scratch for accountability. We implemented our system on Nexus One smartphones and commodity servers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PrivStats is a practical system: computing a common aggregate (e.g., count) over the data of 10,000 clients takes less than 0.46 s at the server and the protocol has modest latency (0.6 s) to upload data from a Nexus phone.

Successful implementation of VANET requires protecting the vehicle's identity at all times and preventing attackers from tracking vehicles and building traveling profiles of other users. The authorities, on the other hand, should be permitted to track certain subjects for non-repudiation and accountability purposes. Researchers have discussed privacy in VANET and have proposed different solutions to protect users' identities, such as using digital signatures.

While the cost of data has plummeted and entire new industries have been created around storing, analyzing, and sorting large sets of data, our legislators have done little to ensure that regulation has kept up with the pace of technological progress. Instead, they have harnessed these powerful tools to advance their own interests by transforming the way they run their campaigns. The age of the ""personalized campaign"" is here - and voters, whether they like it or not, are now being aggressively courted based on their attributes, habits, and behaviors. There are major implications ahead for the future of the quality of our nation's democracy. As both parties engage in an arms race to gather the most information and the most sophisticated data analytics technology, a public increasingly disillusioned with politics doesn't seem to have any meaningful way to ""opt-out."" Without any real legal obligation to disclose what they know and how they use the personal information they collect, campaigns have successfully been able to argue that their activities constitute ""political speech."" A term that was once a critical and valuable protection for free speech is now used as cover for political operatives to act in a non-transparent manner. Many of the same actions used by advertisers that we see as invasive or creepy are now used by the very people we trust to govern our society. Campaigns have reasonably argued that if they were to reveal their tactics, they would be giving away a competitive advantage that could mean the difference between victory and defeat. But this raises larger questions as what new types of barriers to entry this creates for candidates. There are serious questions as to how this will effect those who are not permitted access to these vast troves of information and those who are not able to afford the types of technology needed to now compete in a modern election. It remains to be seen how this will empower incumbents or damage third party challengers outside of the mainstream of the political process. The ""filter bubble"" that has created a world online where each of us sees different content and information has now come to our political process. While this can allow people to hear about the issues that an algorithm thinks they care about most, it can also serve to isolate us even further along partisan lines. When politicians are only focus on telling us the things that we want to hear, it may further degrade the integrity of the entire voting process. Four years is a long time in the world of computing, and the technological capabilities of campaigns in 2016 are sure to dwarf what we saw in the most recent election. There are new opportunities to connect with voters while trying to identify what they care about most that can lead to a more engaging, fulfilling election -- and there are ways to make voting more relevant and efficient. But it is not without consequences. In a process where winning is everything, will campaigns finally set up and institute the proper accountability and oversight that voters deserve.",2013,2015-09-07 07:16:06,2015-09-07 07:16:06,2015-09-07 07:16:06,3–4,,,,,,,PLEAD '13,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,algorithms; design; human factors; legal aspects; management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along with the phenomenal growth in technology enabled information economy has been a growth in computing technology related crimes. Security and privacy issues have become increasingly significant over the years and expected to continue to dominate the technology scene with the increased focus on digital economy and dramatic growth in social networking and the adoption of technologies such as cloud computing by businesses. In this talk I will begin with a brief look at current trends in the technology scenery and some of the key security issues that are impacting on business and society. In particular, I will describe the notion that I refer to as increasing threat velocity, with more and more attacks and their dynamic nature, an evolving set of bad guys with different motives and sophisticated easy to use tools readily available for ordinary users to conduct severe attacks. Hence there is a need for security professionals and researchers to rethink about cyber threats and how to respond to them. In this regard, we will examine attribution which is one of the key issues when it comes to counteracting security attacks. The unauthenticated nature of the Internet makes attribution difficult and furthermore has implications on accountability. Then the talk will focus on attacks and risks in cloud computing, where issues of security, trust and accountability are particularly significant. Cloud computing with its shared multi-tenancy environment aggravates the traditional security threats. Trust that cloud providers will provide proper security measures to counteract the security threats and ensure availability of services and data stored data become paramount.

Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching 'link' fingerprints which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. We validate our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment, and we present optimization mechanisms. We believe this is a promising first step towards using wireless-link characteristics for data provenance in body area networks.",2013,2015-09-07 07:25:01,2015-09-07 07:25:01,2015-09-07 07:25:01,65–72,,,,,,,TrustED '13,,,,ACM,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,body area networks; data provenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Privacy infringement has the potential to lead to serious consequences for the stakeholders involved, hence researchers and organisations have developed various privacy enhancing techniques and tools. However, there is no solution that fits all, and there are instances where privacy solutions could be misused, for example to hide nefarious activities. Therefore, it is important to provide suitable measures and to make necessary design tradeoffs in order to avoid such misuse. This short paper aims to make a case for the need of careful consideration when designing a privacy solution, such that the design effectively addresses the user requirements while at the same time minimises the risk of inadvertently assisting potential offenders. In other words, this paper strives to promote ""sensible privacy"" design, which deals with the complex challenges in balancing privacy, usability and accountability. We illustrate this idea through a case study involving the design of privacy solutions for domestic violence survivors. This is the main contribution of the paper.

Future application platforms will support an open applications and content marketplace where a vast number of vendors offer applications, content, and services to other vendors as well as to consumers. This marketplace will be characterized by extremely large scale and very high churn, with new applications being introduced and others retired at very fast rates. Content will also be produced at very high rates and large volumes, and demand for content will change quickly over time. These attributes of the marketplace will place extreme demands on the supporting infrastructure for agility in resource allocation, as well as scalability, reliability, accountability and security. Cost-effectiveness will require that infrastructure be flexible so that it can be readily re-purposed, essentially reprogrammed, to provide new capabilities. The management and control systems must be designed to provide efficient resource usage and high availability at low operations expense. Multiple owners will provide infrastructure and so the architecture for the infrastructure must be open and allow for interconnection and federation. Crucially, the architecture of the infrastructure should support the rapid introduction of applications, the delivery of applications with targeted levels of Quality of Experience, and the rapid retirement of applications and redeployment of their supporting resources. SAVI takes a ""converged"" view of infrastructure in that all resources whether computing, processing, or networking are viewed as being part of shareable resource pools that can be controlled and managed using the same systems. Future users will typically access the application platform through a mobile device that connects to a ubiquitous very-high-bandwidth, integrated wireless/optical access network. The application platform provides connectivity to services that support the application of interest. Many services will be supported by massive-scale distant datacenters located at sites of renewable energy. Other services will require low latency (alarms in smart grids, safety applications in transportation, monitoring in remote health) or processing of large volumes of local data (e.g., video capture in lecture rooms) provided by converged network and computing resources at the ""smart edge"" of the network, such as the premises of service providers.

This is making data governance in enterprise intractable. In addition, since emerging IT infrastructure such as cloud computing calls for storing enormous amount of confidential and sensitive information, it is imperative that these data must be appropriately handled according to the agreements. These new disruptive trends will greatly change the notions of the information security governance calling for more fine-grained, data-centric, and risk-adjusted governance models with the innovative implementation technologies.
