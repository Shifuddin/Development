Based on the size of the facility and its support infrastructure, it is critical that the user access system be very lean and sustainable for the limited staffing available. In addition to the interlock system, the necessary system functions include a database with user information and authorization levels that can easily be modified by the lab managers. Preventing unauthorized tool use, or any use in the case of a tool that is down, will help maintain user safety and prevent tool damage. Individual user and tool hours are logged to add user accountability, budget tracking, and improve tool maintenance. This project evaluates trade-offs between having a centralized master computer that communicates with ""child"" computers stationed at each major functional area of the lab and having independent computers located separately at each functional area.

With the emergence of the cloud and the benefits it encompasses, there has been a rapid proliferation of services being adopted by commercial and government sectors. However, trust and security concerns for such services are on an unprecedented scale. Currently, these services expose very little internal working to their customers, this can cause accountability and compliance issues especially in the event of a fault or error, customers and providers are left to point finger at each other. Provenance-based trace ability provides a mean to address part of this problem by being able to capture and query events occurred in the past to understand how and why it took place. However, due to the complexity of the cloud infrastructure, the current provenance models lack the expressibility required to describe the inner-working of a cloud service. For a complete solution, a provenance-aware policy language is also required for operators and users to define policies for compliance purpose. The current policy standards do not cater for such requirement. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a provenance (trace ability) model cProv, and a provenance-aware policy language (cProvl) to capture trace ability data, and express policies for validating against the model.

In particular, we demonstrate that the traditional approach of digital signature (DS) based solutions to the accountability needs of a message communication system is only one part of the overall problem. In a multihop message delivery system (where the hops could be physically separated routers. Or logically distinct multiple software modules), there can be other aspects of accountability that may not be addressed using DS techniques. We identify a specific problem, namely the sender's ambiguity problem (SAP), that remains to be solved if a comprehensive treatment to accountability could be developed. The primary focus of this paper is to identify the SAP problem (and, hence, raise a point that DS alone cannot completely solve the accountability problem). Then we present an outline of our research in SAP framework. The framework includes NRP categories, NRP types of services, NRP levels of certification.

These employees, for their own benefits, are capable of accessing data illegally, modifying or inserting data temporary then illegally outputting data, and finally changing data back to their original status that satisfy integrity of database contents. Usually databases are updated through record overwriting or deleting and are difficult to trace each user transaction. Hence, owners of these database systems, potentially, might become victims of data temporary misuse by criminals. Ooi, Goh, and Tan proposed a dimension space transformation concept based on indexing bitemporal databases1998, which states the concept of transforming one-dimensional time domain to two-dimensional x-y coordinates.

From health records to ballots, almost all documents are now digitized at some point of their life cycle, easily copied, altered, and distributed. In Burdens of Proof, Jean-FranÃ§ois Blanchette examines the challenge of defining a new evidentiary framework for electronic documents, focusing on the design of a digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.From the blackboards of mathematicians to the halls of legislative assemblies, Blanchette traces the path of such an equivalent: digital signatures based on the mathematics of public-key cryptography. In the mid-1990s, cryptographic signatures formed the centerpiece of a worldwide wave of legal reform and of an ambitious cryptographic research agenda that sought to build privacy, anonymity, and accountability into the very infrastructure of the Internet. Yet markets for cryptographic products collapsed in the aftermath of the dot-com boom and bust along with cryptography's social projects.Blanchette describes the trials of French bureaucracies as they wrestled with the application of electronic signatures to real estate contracts, birth certificates, and land titles, and tracks the convoluted paths through which electronic documents acquire moral authority. These paths suggest that the material world need not merely succumb to the virtual but, rather, can usefully inspire it. Indeed, Blanchette argues, in renewing their engagement with the material world, cryptographers might also find the key to broader acceptance of their design goals.",,9780262301565,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6281825.pdf&bkn=6267548&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,,,2012,,,,MIT Press,MIT Press eBook Chapters

In our scheme, we can revoke one attribute of a user instead of all attributes issued to him and the user can complete decryption as long as the unrevoked attributes of the user satisfy the access structure. The revocation does not affect any other user's private key. Moreover, our scheme supports an important property for achieving the user accountability to prevent illegal key sharing among colluding users. We show how to construct such a KP-ABE scheme with fine-grained attribute revocation and prove its security under the q-BDHE assumption in the standard model.",1930-529X,978-1-4673-0920-2,978-1-4673-0919-6,10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503225,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503225,accountability;attribute-based encryption;keypolicy;revocation,,authorisation;private key cryptography;public key cryptography,KP-ABE scheme;access structure;attribute based encryption scheme;decryption;direct revocation model;fine-grained access control;fine-grained attribute revocation mechanism;illegal key sharing;public key primitive;q-BDHE assumption;user private key,,0,,12,,,3-7 Dec. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

PLEDGE follows an end-to-end policy-driven security approach to secure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of fixed-content entities over the enterprise network links and in the nodes of the CAS device. It utilizes a customizable and configurable XML security policy to provide flexible, multi-level, and fine-grained encryption and hashing methodologies to fixed content CAS entities. PLEDGE secures data objects based on their content and sensitivity and highly overcomes the performance of bulk and raw encryption protocols such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. Moreover, PLEDGE transparently stores sensitive objects encrypted (partially or totally) in the CAS storage nodes without affecting the CAS storage system operation or performance and takes into consideration the processing load, computing power, and memory capabilities of the client devices which may be constrained by limited processing power, memory resources, or network connectivity. PLEDGE complies with the strictest compliance regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and the SEC Rule 17a-4 financial standards. The protocol is implemented in a real CAS network using an EMC Centera backend storage device. The application secured by PLEDGE in the sample implementation is an X-Ray radiography scanning system in a healthcare network environment.",,978-1-4244-0974-7,978-1-4244-0975-4,10.1109/SECCOM.2007.4550309,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4550309,content-addressable storage security;customizable security;policy-driven security,Computer networks;Content addressable storage;Cryptography;Data security;Insurance;Power system security;Protection;Sockets;Transport protocols;XML,,,,0,1,,,,17-21 Sept. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Additionally, a general overview will be given on distributed reconfigurable mobile terminals in a personal area network (PAN) context. The PAN may include a number of mobile devices, which need to exchange information with each other and with their users; technologies such as Bluetooth, IrDA and WLAN could be employed. Thus, secure data transfer will be needed for properties such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation of data. However, the ability of a device to reconfigure raises a number of security issues that will need to be addressed in order to realize the potential of the reconfigurable domain. A highly distributed environment suggests the requirement for security delegation techniques. Additionally, threats increase from malicious software such as viruses, Trojan horses and worms. One can employ secure mobile delegation for securing software upgrades in reconfigurable terminals, from high-level applications and system software, such as ring tones, down to lower-layer baseband modules. With our novel delegation schemes we show that it is possible to maintain end-to-end accountability and at the same time have compact and lightweight cascade characteristics.

However, security solutions based on PKI have to be usable to be effective otherwise they will not provide the intended protection. This paper presents the Audited Credential Delegation (ACD), a user-centric security identity management solution that accommodates users and resource providers security requirements including authentication, authorisation and auditing security goals from the design level. The proposed architecture removes any association between users and digital certificates, which is the source of the grid usability problem, while addressing resource providers concerns with regards to accountability.

From health records to ballots, almost all documents are now digitized at some point of their life cycle, easily copied, altered, and distributed. In Burdens of Proof, Jean-FranÃ§ois Blanchette examines the challenge of defining a new evidentiary framework for electronic documents, focusing on the design of a digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.From the blackboards of mathematicians to the halls of legislative assemblies, Blanchette traces the path of such an equivalent: digital signatures based on the mathematics of public-key cryptography. In the mid-1990s, cryptographic signatures formed the centerpiece of a worldwide wave of legal reform and of an ambitious cryptographic research agenda that sought to build privacy, anonymity, and accountability into the very infrastructure of the Internet. Yet markets for cryptographic products collapsed in the aftermath of the dot-com boom and bust along with cryptography's social projects.Blanchette describes the trials of French bureaucracies as they wrestled with the application of electronic signatures to real estate contracts, birth certificates, and land titles, and tracks the convoluted paths through which electronic documents acquire moral authority. These paths suggest that the material world need not merely succumb to the virtual but, rather, can usefully inspire it. Indeed, Blanchette argues, in renewing their engagement with the material world, cryptographers might also find the key to broader acceptance of their design goals.",,9780262301565,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6281824.pdf&bkn=6267548&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,,,2012,,,,MIT Press,MIT Press eBook Chapters

BI faces sophisticated security issues given its strategic importance for higher management of business entities. Scholars have emphasized on enhanced session, presentation and application layer security in BI, in addition to the usual network and transport layer security controls. This is because an unauthorized user can gain access to highly sensitive consolidated business information in a BI system. To protect a BI environment, a number of controls are needed at the level of database objects, application files, and the underlying servers. In a cloud environment, the controls will be needed at all the components employed in the service-oriented architecture for hosting BI on the cloud. Hence, a BI environment (whether self-hosted or cloud-hosted) is expected to face significant security overheads. In this context, two models for securing BI on a cloud have been simulated in this paper. The first model is based on securing BI using a Unified Threat Management (UTM) cloud and the second model is based on distributed security controls embedded within the BI server arrays deployed throughout the Cloud. The simulation results revealed that the UTM model is expected to cause more overheads and bottlenecks per OLAP user than the distributed security model. However, the distributed security model is expected to pose administrative control effectiveness challenges than the UTM model. Based on the simulation results, it is recommended that BI security model on a Cloud should comprise of network, transport, session and presentation layers of security controls through UTM, and application layer security through the distributed security components. A mixed environment of both the models will ensure technical soundness of security controls, better security processes, - learly defined roles and accountabilities, and effectiveness of controls.",,978-1-4673-5659-6,,10.1109/SOSE.2013.36,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525515,Application Layer Security;Business Intelligence;Cloud Computing;Data Mart Security;Data Warehouse Security;Distributed Security Controls;OLAP Security;Object Level Security;Online Analytical Processing;Unified Threat Management,Bismuth;Business;Data mining;Data warehouses;Databases;Security;Servers,cloud computing;competitive intelligence;data mining;security of data;service-oriented architecture,OLAP functionalities;UTM;business entities;business intelligence security;clouds;critical software system;online analytical processing;security controls;security process;service-oriented architecture;unified threat management,,1,,30,,,25-28 March 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Proceedings of the 37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on",20040226,2004,,,8 pp.,,"The control objectives for information and related technology (COBIT) is a ""trusted"" open standard that is being used increasingly by a diverse range of organizations throughout the world. COBIT is arguably the most appropriate control framework to help an organization ensure alignment between use of information technology (IT) and its business goals, as it places emphasis on the business need that is satisfied by each control objective by J. Colbert, and P. Bowen (1996). This paper reports on the use of a simple classification of the published literature on COBIT, to highlight some of the features of that literature. The appropriate alignment between use of IT and the business goals of a organization is fundamental to efficient and effective IT governance. IT governance ""...is the structure of relationships and processes to develop, direct and control IS/IT resources in order to achieve the enterprise's goals"". IT governance has been recognized as a critical success factor in the achievement of corporate success by deploying information through the application of technology by N. Korac-Kakabadse and A. Kakabadse (2001). The importance of IT governance can be appreciated in light of the Gartner Group's finding that large organizations spend over 50% of their capital investment on IT by C. Koch (2002). However, research has suggested that the contribution of IT governance varies in its effectiveness. IT control frameworks are designed to promote effective IT governance. Recent pressures, including the failure of organizations such as Enron, have led to an increased focus on corporate accountability. For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 introduced legislation that imposed new governance requirements by G. Coppin (2003). These and other changes have resulted in a new corporate governance model with an increased emphasis on IT governance, which goes beyond the traditional focus of corporate governance on financial aspects by R. Roussey (2003).",,0-7695-2056-1,,10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265566,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265566,,Control systems;Financial management;Information technology;Investments;Legislation;Pressure control;Risk management;Security;Standardization;Standards organizations,business data processing;information technology;legislation,COBIT;IT control framework;IT governance;Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002;business goal;control objectives for information and related technology;corporate governance model;financial aspect;information technology,,14,,25,,,5-8 Jan. 2004,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this work, we present a generic data lineage framework LIME for data flow across multiple entities that take two characteristic, principal roles (i.e., owner and consumer). We define the exact security guarantees required by such a data lineage mechanism toward identification of a guilty entity, and identify the simplifying non-repudiation and honesty assumptions. We then develop and analyze a novel accountable data transfer protocol between two entities within a malicious environment by building upon oblivious transfer, robust watermarking, and signature primitives. Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation to demonstrate the practicality of our protocol and apply our framework to the important data leakage scenarios of data outsourcing and social networks.

While it is certainly true that government public policies and regulations have played a major role in the rapidly growing rate at which distributed generation is penetrating the market, it is also the case that a number of technologies have reached a development stage allowing for large-scale implementation within existing electric utility systems. At the onset of any discussion related to distributed generation, one question begs to be answered: is the fact that electric power producing facilities are distributed actually a new and revolutionary concept? Have power plants not always been located across broad expanses of land? The answer to these questions clearly is that electric power plants have always been sited all across the service territories of the utilities owning them. Hence, the opening question: as with many so-called innovations that have been put forward during the recent past, is the entire concept of distributed generation a simple semantic marketing hype or are we actually at the dawn of a new electric power generation era? We believe that a new electric power production industry is emerging, and that it will rely on a broad array of new technologies.

Efficient Blind Signatures for Accountability,"Chakrabarti, S.; Chandrasekhar, S.; Calvert, K.L.; Singhal, M.","Univ. of Kentucky, Lexington","Secure Network Protocols, 2007.

We observe that blind signatures have potential to form critical building blocks of network security protocols, where an authority needs to vouch for the legitimacy of a message but there is also a need to keep the ownership of the message secret from the authority. Different forms of blind signature constructions exist in the literature and have found valuable use in areas such E-Cash technology and E-voting schemes. However, conventional blind signatures are quite heavyweight and thus, a direct application of these traditional signatures face scalability and performance challenges. In this paper, we present a novel third-order linear feedback shift register (LFSR) sequence-based, 2-party signature scheme, EGCLFSR, following a well-known variant of the generalized ElGamal signature scheme. Using EGCLFSR, and following fundamentals of a well known blind signature, originally used for E-Cash systems, we present an efficient blind signature BCLFSR (also the first blind signature based on LFSR sequences), which can serve as a protocol building block for privacy-preserving accountability systems. We perform a theoretical analysis including correctness and security of BCLFSR and also present a performance (computation and communication costs, storage overhead) comparison of the proposed scheme with well-known traditional constructions.",,978-1-4244-1603-5,978-1-4244-1603-5,10.1109/NPSEC.2007.4371624,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4371624,Accountability;ElGamal signature;GH;LFSR sequence;XTR;blind signature;cubic LFSR-based cryptosystems;privacy-preserving accountability,Application software;Computer science;Cryptographic protocols;Cryptography;Electronic voting;Information security;Laboratories;Linear feedback shift registers;Privacy;Scalability,Internet;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;digital signatures;shift registers;telecommunication security,EGCLFSR scheme;ElGamal signature scheme;Internet;LFSR sequence-based 2-party signature scheme;blind signatures;network security protocols;privacy-preserving accountability systems;third-order linear feedback shift register,,2,1,27,,,16-16 Oct. 2007,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Such accountability tracked through standard manual procedures is highly inefficient and prone to human error. The ability to actively and autonomously monitor both personnel and critical assets can significantly enhance security and safety operations while removing significant levels of human reliability issues and reducing insider threat concerns. A Real-Time Location System (RTLS) encompasses several technologies that use wireless signals to determine the precise location of tagged critical assets or personnel. RTLS systems include tags that either transmit or receive signals at regular intervals, location sensors/beacons that receive/transmit signals, and a location appliance that collects and correlates the data. Combined with ephemeral biometrics (EB) to validate the live-state of a user, an ephemeral biometrically-enhanced RTLS (EMBERS) can eliminate time-consuming manual searches and audits by providing precise location data. If critical assets or people leave a defined secured area, EMBERS can automatically trigger an alert and function as an access control mechanism and/or ingress/egress monitoring tool. Three different EMBERS application scenarios for safety and security have been analyzed and the heuristic results of this study are outlined in this paper along with areas of technological improvements and innovations that can be made if EMBERS is to be used as safety and security tool.",,978-1-4799-3530-7,,10.1109/CCST.2014.6986971,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986971,Access control;authentication;biometrics;computer security;identification of persons;identity management systems,Access control;Authentication;Biometrics (access control);Monitoring;Personnel;Safety,authorisation;biometrics (access control);real-time systems;reliability,EMBERS;RTLS;access control mechanism;authentication;computer security;critical assets;ephemeral biometrically enhanced real-time location system;identity management systems;location appliance;location beacons;location sensors;nuclear facilities;personnel assets;personnel locations;reliability;time-consuming manual searches;wireless signals,,0,,,,,13-16 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Epilogue,"Blanchette, J.",,Burdens of Proof:Cryptographic Culture and Evidence Law in the Age of Electronic Documents,20120924,2012,,,187,190,"The gradual disappearance of paper and its familiar evidential qualities affects almost every dimension of contemporary life. From health records to ballots, almost all documents are now digitized at some point of their life cycle, easily copied, altered, and distributed. In Burdens of Proof, Jean-FranÃ§ois Blanchette examines the challenge of defining a new evidentiary framework for electronic documents, focusing on the design of a digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.From the blackboards of mathematicians to the halls of legislative assemblies, Blanchette traces the path of such an equivalent: digital signatures based on the mathematics of public-key cryptography. In the mid-1990s, cryptographic signatures formed the centerpiece of a worldwide wave of legal reform and of an ambitious cryptographic research agenda that sought to build privacy, anonymity, and accountability into the very infrastructure of the Internet. Yet markets for cryptographic products collapsed in the aftermath of the dot-com boom and bust along with cryptography's social projects.Blanchette describes the trials of French bureaucracies as they wrestled with the application of electronic signatures to real estate contracts, birth certificates, and land titles, and tracks the convoluted paths through which electronic documents acquire moral authority. These paths suggest that the material world need not merely succumb to the virtual but, rather, can usefully inspire it. Indeed, Blanchette argues, in renewing their engagement with the material world, cryptographers might also find the key to broader acceptance of their design goals.",,9780262301565,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6281816.pdf&bkn=6267548&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,,,2012,,,,MIT Press,MIT Press eBook Chapters

The incorporation of environmental factors into authorization decisions has made this particularly important and challenging. An environmental factor that has not previously been considered in this effort to provide such assistance to users arises in systems where obligations can depend on and affect authorizations. In these systems, it is desirable to ensure that users will have the authorizations they require to fulfill their obligations, and prior work has proposed denying requests to perform non-obligatory actions that would cause this property to become violated, whether the violation is a direct result of the requested action or due to obligations that would be incurred as a result of it. Because of privacy concerns, as well as the intricate interactions between actions and pending obligations, the current work focuses on helping users find means of overcoming their denials, rather than focusing on explanation of the cause for denial.

Formal Analysis of Chaumian Mix Nets with Randomized Partial Checking,"Ku&#x0308;sters, R.; Truderung, T.; Vogt, A.","Univ. of Trier, Trier, Germany","Security and Privacy (SP), 2014 IEEE Symposium on",20141120,2014,,,343,358,"Mix nets with randomized partial checking (RPC mix nets) have been introduced by Jakobsson, Juels, and Rivest as particularly simple and efficient verifiable mix nets. These mix nets have been used in several implementations of prominent e-voting systems to provide vote privacy and verifiability. In RPC mix nets, higher efficiency is traded for a lower level of privacy and verifiability. However, these mix nets have never undergone a rigorous formal analysis. Recently, Kahazei and Wikstroem even pointed out several severe problems in the original proposal and in implementations of RPC mix nets in e-voting systems, both for so-called re-encryption and Chaumian RPC mix nets. While Kahazei and Wikstroem proposed several fixes, the security status of Chaumian RPC mix nets (with the fixes applied) has been left open, re-encryption RPC mix nets, as they suggest, should not be used at all.

We propose security definitions that allow one to measure the level of privacy and verifiability RPC mix nets offer, and then based on these definitions, carry out a rigorous analysis.

The system is intended to provide indoor/outdoor precision navigation, robust communications and real-time position updates on remote command display devices. Operational requirements include rapid and nonintrusive deployment, scalability to 500 users and seamless integration with existing procedures. Additional challenges are imposed by the need for a device that minimizes size, weight, and power with the ability to operate in uncertain and potentially hazardous in-building environments. The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (Program Manager - Dr. Jalal Mapar) has sponsored Honeywell, with team members Argon ST and TRX Systems, to develop the Geo-spatial Location, Accountability and Navigation System for Emergency Responders (GLANSER). GLANSER is currently in its Option 1 phase which is the second of a four-year program to migrate the technology from concept development all the way to product and operations (1). This paper describes development of both the current and continuing development of GLANSER system components, including the overall architecture, the navigation sensors (e.g. IMU, Doppler velocimeter), the sensor fusion and navigator design, the integrated networking, ranging, and data communications radio, the display implementation and a description of the heuristic elements, including automatic map building and constraint-based navigation corrections. It also describes testing protocols and recent navigation performance results of the prototype system.

To accomplish this, Grids need infrastructure that supports various services: security, uniform access, resource management, scheduling, application composition, computational economy, and accounting. Although several initiatives are engaged in the development of Grid technologies, Grid accounting issues are yet to be addressed. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new infrastructure called GridBank that provides services for accounting. The support of computational economy and accounting services can lead to a self-regulated accountability in Grid computing. This paper presents requirements of Grid accounting and different economic models within which it can operate and proposes a Grid Accounting Services Architecture to meet them.

HIPAA and QMS Based Architectural Requirements to Cope with the OCR Audit Program,"Gardazi, S.U.; Shahid, A.A.; Salimbene, C.","Comput. Sci. Dept., Nat. Univ. of Comput. & Emerging Sci., Islamabad, Pakistan","Mobile, Ubiquitous, and Intelligent Computing (MUSIC), 2012 Third FTRA International Conference on",20120920,2012,,,246,253,"The United States legislation known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is aimed at strengthening patient rights, increasing efficiency and decreasing administrative costs in the healthcare industry. Under HIPAA all Covered Entities are required to ensure compliance with certain privacy and security rules concerned with protecting private patient health information. Building upon the objectives of HIPAA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, in Section 13411 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct periodic audits of Covered Entities against HIPAA Security Rule. This paper presents and evaluates a new approach which might be used by Covered Entities to achieve compliance with HIPAA by adopting the ISO 9001 guidelines. A United States based Healthcare IT Company (UHITC) with a backup office in Pakistan was taken as a case study for this approach. UHITC develops software for mobile devices along with providing third party medical billing services. In connection with its achieving ISO 9001 certification since 2004, UHITC had already developed a company-wide quality audit protocol based on the ISO 9001 standard. For purposes of conforming the ISO standards to the HIPAA audit protocol in a streamlined fashion, UHITC examined the HIPAA requirements to determine whether the existing protocol could be tailored to achieve HIPAA compliance. In order to accomplish this evaluation, the two standards were compared by cross-mapping their components. The comparison revealed that the controls mentioned in the ISO 9001 guideline meet or exceed the HIPAA Security Rule for 36% of the implementation requirements. UHITC was also able to increase customer satisfaction by achieving compliance with HIPAA Security Rule using a quality management system (QMS) model. At the next level, Compliance Attributes (CA) were deri- ed from these requirements and classified as architectural and non-architectural in nature.

Effective security countermeasures to combat computer crime parallel those used to protect against potential threats due to cyber terrorism and information warfare. Federal data about crime indicate that the growth in prosecution of computer crime is lower than the growth of computer incidents. A survey of the attitudes and activities of college students also revealed that current policy does not provide a strong deterrent to computer crime. Current policy, as expressed in the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, does not hold organizational management accountable when their computers are broken into by hackers. However, security organizations repeatedly state that many if not most, computer intrusions occur largely because the host operating system has not had the latest fixes applied. Sometimes notices of system vulnerabilities have been widely published for months, but because available fixes were not applied, hackers using sophisticated attack tools, were able to locate exposed hosts on the Internet and attack those vulnerabilities. Hackers share vulnerability information via informal groups linked through the Internet, while government and private industry are reluctant to share vulnerability information. This characteristic gives attackers an advantage that helps them exploit host weaknesses. A recommendation is made to hold managers in the government and private sector more accountable for keeping their computer assets updated with the latest operating system fixes, to improve computer security and protect the national infrastructure",,0-7803-6262-4,,10.1109/NAECON.2000.894921,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=894921,,Computer crime;Computer hacking;Computer security;Data security;Government;Information security;Internet;Operating systems;Protection;Terrorism,computer crime,Computer Fraud and Abuse Act;Internet;computer crime;computer hacker;cyber criminal;cyber terrorist;information warfare;management accountability;national infrastructure;operating system;security organization,,0,,20,,,2000,10 Oct 2000-12 Oct 2000,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

HIP enhances the original Internet architecture by adding a name space used between the IP layer and the transport protocols. This new name space consists of cryptographic identifiers, thereby implementing the so-called identifier/locator split. In the new architecture, the new identifiers are used in naming application level end-points (sockets), replacing the prior identification role of IP addresses in applications, sockets, TCP connections, and UDP-based send and receive system calls. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are still used, but only as names for topological locations in the network. HIP can be deployed such that no changes are needed in applications or routers. Almost all pre-compiled legacy applications continue to work, without modifications, for communicating with both HIP-enabled and non-HIP-enabled peer hosts. The architectural enhancement implemented by HIP has profound consequences. A number of the previously hard networking problems become suddenly much easier. Mobility, multi-homing, and baseline end-to-end security integrate neatly into the new architecture. The use of cryptographic identifiers allows enhanced accountability, thereby providing a base for easier build up of trust. With privacy enhancements, HIP allows good location anonymity, assuring strong identity only towards relevant trusted parties. Finally, the HIP protocols have been carefully designed to take middle boxes into account, providing for overlay networks and enterprise deployment concerns.

Trends in the oil and gas industry to improve safety and efficiency and reduce environmental impact suggest the use of industrial robotics. New developments in regions difficult or dangerous for humans to work in could be enabled with maintenance, inspection and repairs carried out by remotely-controlled industrial robots. This new application area highlights some difficulties with today's robots, as they do not adapt well to dynamic environments, do not offer rich human-robot interaction and are not simple for end-users to program. In addition, the oil and gas context presents a challenging work environment for robots as they are exposed to variable and often extreme weather and need to be safe for use alongside explosive hydrocarbons. As robots are introduced, issues of trust and accountability come to the fore as well as how they fit into organisational structures. If robots have too little autonomy, human operators will waste time attending to robots instead of attending to their work tasks. If robots are highly autonomous, situational awareness of plant activity is diminished. A balance needs to be struck to find a level of autonomy suitable for the task, the realistic capabilities of the automation, and the need to actively engage human operators in a constructive fashion. These issues also relate to what form the interface takes for remote or co-located robot control, as well as how information and activity is represented for remote operators.

In addition, the definition of CREM has been expanded and the number of CREM has increased significantly. Procedures now require that all CREM be inventoried and accounted for on a weekly basis. Weekly inventories consist of a physical comparison of each item against the reportable inventory listing. Securing and accounting for CREM is a continuous challenge for existing security systems. To address the challenge, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has developed an automated electronic media security system (EMSS) for a weekly CREM inventory collection and reporting system. The EMSS approach is to tag the CREM with an electronically readable unique identification code and automatically collect data on the inventory in each security container or vault at a user-defined interval and upon detection of an access event, thus eliminating the need for hand-written inventory sheets while allowing automated transfer of the collected inventory data to an electronic reporting system. An electronic log of CREM access events is maintained, providing enhanced accountability for daily/weekly checks, routine audits, and follow-up investigations. The key attributes of the EMSS include improved accountability, reduced risk of human error, improved accuracy and timeliness of inventory data, and reduced costs as a result of man-hour reductions.",,0-7803-9121-7,,10.1109/MSHS.2005.1502552,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1502552,,Alarm systems;Containers;Costs;Data security;Documentation;Energy storage;Humans;Laboratories;National security;Secure storage,identification technology;security of data;storage management;storage media,Department of Energy Laboratories;access events;classified removable electronic media storage;electronic media security system;electronic tag;electronically readable identification code;security lapses;weekly inventory collection;weekly inventory reporting system,,0,1,,,,29-30 March 2005,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

From health records to ballots, almost all documents are now digitized at some point of their life cycle, easily copied, altered, and distributed. In Burdens of Proof, Jean-FranÃ§ois Blanchette examines the challenge of defining a new evidentiary framework for electronic documents, focusing on the design of a digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.From the blackboards of mathematicians to the halls of legislative assemblies, Blanchette traces the path of such an equivalent: digital signatures based on the mathematics of public-key cryptography. In the mid-1990s, cryptographic signatures formed the centerpiece of a worldwide wave of legal reform and of an ambitious cryptographic research agenda that sought to build privacy, anonymity, and accountability into the very infrastructure of the Internet. Yet markets for cryptographic products collapsed in the aftermath of the dot-com boom and bust along with cryptography's social projects.Blanchette describes the trials of French bureaucracies as they wrestled with the application of electronic signatures to real estate contracts, birth certificates, and land titles, and tracks the convoluted paths through which electronic documents acquire moral authority. These paths suggest that the material world need not merely succumb to the virtual but, rather, can usefully inspire it. Indeed, Blanchette argues, in renewing their engagement with the material world, cryptographers might also find the key to broader acceptance of their design goals.",,9780262301565,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6281814.pdf&bkn=6267548&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,,,2012,,,,MIT Press,MIT Press eBook Chapters

Key management for secure lnternet multicast using Boolean function minimization techniques,"Chang, I.; Engel, R.; Kandlur, D.; Pendarakis, D.; Saha, D.","IBM Thomas J. Watson Res. Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA",INFOCOM '99. Eighteenth Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies. Proceedings. IEEE,20020806,1999,2,,689,698 vol.2,"The Internet provides no support for privacy or authentication of multicast packets. However, an increasing number of applications require secure multicast services in order to restrict group membership and enforce accountability of group members. A major problem associated with the deployment of secure multicast delivery services is the scalability of the key distribution protocol. This is particularly true with regard to the handling of group membership changes, such as member departures and/or expulsions, which necessitate the distribution of a new session key to all the remaining group members. As the frequency of group membership changes increases, it becomes necessary to reduce the cost of key distribution operations. This paper explores the use of batching of group membership changes to reduce the frequency, and hence the cost, of key re-distribution operations. It focuses explicitly on the problem of cumulative member removal and presents an algorithm that minimizes the number of messages required to distribute new keys to the remaining group members. The algorithm is used in conjunction with a new multicast key management scheme which uses a set of auxiliary keys in order to improve scalability. In contrast to previous schemes which generate a fixed hierarchy of keys, the proposed scheme dynamically generates the most suitable key hierarchy by composing different keys. Our cumulative member removal algorithm uses Boolean function minimization techniques, and outperforms all other schemes known to us in terms of message complexity",0743-166X,0-7803-5417-6,,10.1109/INFCOM.1999.751455,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=751455,,Authentication;Boolean functions;Costs;Frequency;Internet;Minimization methods;Multicast algorithms;Multicast protocols;Privacy;Scalability,Boolean functions;Internet;computer network management;minimisation;multicast communication;protocols;telecommunication security,Boolean function minimization techniques;accountability;authentication;auxiliary keys;cumulative member removal;cumulative member removal algorithm;expulsion;group members;group membership;key distribution operations;key distribution protocol;key hierarchy;key management;key re-distribution operations;member departures;message complexity;multicast key management scheme;multicast packets;privacy;scalability;secure lnternet multicast;secure multicast delivery services;session key,,41,12,17,,,21-25 Mar 1999,21 Mar 1999-25 Mar 1999,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In the smart grid, smart meters equipped with wireless sensors can upload meter readings (data) to smart grid control and schedule centers via the advanced metering infrastructure to improve power delivery efficiency. However, data gathered in short intervals, such as 15 minutes, will expose customers' detailed daily activities (for example, when they get up and when they use oven) using nonintrusive appliance load monitoring. Thus, data must be hidden to protect customers' privacy. However, data accountability is still required for emergency responses or to trace back suspected intrusions, even though the data is anonymous. In addition to desired security requirements, this imposes two extra tasks: Sensors in smart meters usually have resource constraints; thus, the desired security protocols have to remain lightweight in terms of computation and storage cost. Furthermore, scalability and flexibility are required since there exist vast meters. This paper presents a lightweight Privacy-aware yet Accountable Secure Scheme called PASS which guarantees privacy-aware accountability yet tackles the above challenges in the smart grid. A formal security analysis justifies that PASS can attain the security goals, while a performance analysis verifies that PASS requires few computations, and is scalable and flexible.",,,,10.1016/S1007-0214(11)70084-0,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6133358,accountability;privacy;smart grid;smart meter sensor,Data privacy;Intelligent sensors;Network security;Privacy;Smart grids;Wireless sensor networks,,,,0,,,,,Dec. 2011,,TUP,TUP Journals & Magazines

The structures of those logs seldom consider requirements for accountability, preventing effective dispute resolution. We address the question of what information should be included in logs to make their a posteriori compliance analysis meaningful. Real-world scenarios are used to show that decisions about log architecture are nontrivial and should be made from the design stage on. Four categories of situations for which straightforward solutions are problematic are presented. Our contribution shows how log content choices and accountability definitions mutually affect each other and incites service providers to rethink up to what extent they can be held responsible.

This research presents a distributed event correlation system which performs security event detection, and evaluates it experimentally, compared with a centralized alternative. The comparison measures the value in distributed event correlation by considering network bandwidth utilization, detection capability and database query efficiency.

MarketNet uses market-based techniques to regulate access to resources. Access to a resource must be paid-for with currency issued by its domain. Domains can control the power of attackers by limiting the budgets allocated to them, and control the exposure of resources by setting their prices, effectively providing a quantifiable access control mechanism. Domains can monitor currency flows and use uniform resource-independent statistical algorithms to correlate and detect access anomalies indicating potential attacks. Currency is marked with unique identifiers that permit domains to establish verifiable accountability in accessing their resources. Domains control and fine tune their exposure to attacks; adjust this exposure in response to emerging risks; detect intrusion attacks through automated, uniform statistical analysis of currency flows; and establish coordinated response to attacks. MarketNet mechanisms unify and kernelize global information systems protection by containing all protection logic in a small core of software components.

This new field was motivated by the desire to provide a unified interface capable of supporting various services across the many types of delivery networks that are available. This has resulted in a rush to develop and implement new standards and protocols that can support a multiplicity of media services such as the ""Triple Play"" (voice, data and video), and the ""Quadruple Play"" (voice, data, video and mobility). Among the emerging standards is the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) that is an overlay control subsystem across heterogeneous access networks. IMS will enable fixed and mobile convergence and support service mobility. On the practical side, an intense competition is underway among fixed and mobile network operators where each is fighting to be the leader in providing fixed-mobile convergence in the least amount of time. Concurrently, another competition related to application convergence is gathering momentum among Internet Service Providers and Content Providers to win customer ownership. One of the other important components in the convergence realm is the need for adopting security techniques and policies that ensure confidentiality, privacy, anonymity, availability and accountability. Clearly, the above activities cannot be sustained and enhanced without developing an appropriate regulatory framework that defines the roles, rights and responsibilities of all involved parties.

Notes,"Blanchette, J.",,Burdens of Proof:Cryptographic Culture and Evidence Law in the Age of Electronic Documents,20120924,2012,,,193,232,"The gradual disappearance of paper and its familiar evidential qualities affects almost every dimension of contemporary life. From health records to ballots, almost all documents are now digitized at some point of their life cycle, easily copied, altered, and distributed. In Burdens of Proof, Jean-FranÃ§ois Blanchette examines the challenge of defining a new evidentiary framework for electronic documents, focusing on the design of a digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.From the blackboards of mathematicians to the halls of legislative assemblies, Blanchette traces the path of such an equivalent: digital signatures based on the mathematics of public-key cryptography. In the mid-1990s, cryptographic signatures formed the centerpiece of a worldwide wave of legal reform and of an ambitious cryptographic research agenda that sought to build privacy, anonymity, and accountability into the very infrastructure of the Internet. Yet markets for cryptographic products collapsed in the aftermath of the dot-com boom and bust along with cryptography's social projects.Blanchette describes the trials of French bureaucracies as they wrestled with the application of electronic signatures to real estate contracts, birth certificates, and land titles, and tracks the convoluted paths through which electronic documents acquire moral authority. These paths suggest that the material world need not merely succumb to the virtual but, rather, can usefully inspire it. Indeed, Blanchette argues, in renewing their engagement with the material world, cryptographers might also find the key to broader acceptance of their design goals.",,9780262301565,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6281813.pdf&bkn=6267548&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,,,2012,,,,MIT Press,MIT Press eBook Chapters

The approach starts from a flexible definition of privacy constraints, applies encryption on information in a parsimonious way and mostly relies on attribute partition to protect sensitive information. Based on the approximation algorithm for the minimal encryption attribute partition, the approach allows storing the outsourced data on un-trusted database server and minimizing the amount of encrypted data. By combining cryptographic with auxiliary random server, the approach can reduce the computational and communication complexity of private information retrieval to provide user privacy protection. By introducing verifiable encryption and revocation of decryption based on event capsule, the approach obtains accountability when the user misbehaves.

Peer-to-peer networks,"Sen, J.","Innovation Lab., Tata Consultancy Services, Kolkata, India","Emerging Trends and Applications in Computer Science (NCETACS), 2012 3rd National Conference on",20120521,2012,,,iv,v,"Summary form only given. The term peer-to-peer (P2P) system encompasses a broad set of distributed applications which allow sharing of computer resources by direct exchange between systems. The goal of a P2P system is to aggregate resources available at the edge of Internet and to share it cooperatively among users. Specially, the file sharing P2P systems have become popular as a new paradigm for information exchange among large number of users in the Internet. They are more robust, scalable, fault tolerant and offer better availability of resources than the traditional client server model. Depending on the presence of a central server, P2P systems can be classified as centralized or decentralized. In decentralized architecture, both resource discovery and resource download are distributed. Decentralized P2P architectures may further be classified as structured or unstructured networks. In structured networks, there are certain restrictions on the placement of contents and the network topologies. In unstructured P2P networks, however, placement of contents is unrelated to the topologies of the network. Unstructured P2P networks perform better than their structured counterparts in dynamic environments. However, they need efficient search mechanisms and they also suffer from numerous problems such as: fake content distribution, free riding (peers who do not share, but consume resources), whitewashing (peers who leave and rejoin the system in order to avoid penalties) and lack of scalability in searching. Open and anonymous nature of P2P applications lead to complete lack of accountability of the contents that a peer may put in the network. The malicious peers often use these networks to do content poisoning and to distribute harmful programs such as Trojan Horses and viruses. In this talk, we will discuss various architectures of the current p2p systems and the major challenges in deployment and operations of such networks such as scalability, quality of services of - pplications, security and privacy of users and applications etc. After a generic introduction of these issues, we will present a search algorithm for p2p networks which is able to combat the problem of inauthentic file downloads. The searching algorithm is also able to improve search scalability while protecting the privacy of the users.

Fine-grained policy integration algorithms are needed to support dynamic coalitions and virtual organizations that need to quickly share and integrate information. Policies must adapt, based on events and contexts, to support continuous access to critical information resources. Enforcement mechanisms are also needed to allow different parties to take joint decisions about data accesses. In this talk, we will first discuss the various policies that are relevant in the context of secure information sharing across collaborating organizations.

This review aims to understand the approaches covered by main research streams in that area and to highlight the advantages of the essential and most renowned solutions. The review of the literature quickly provides a plethora of publications that presents innovative proposals on the matter of policy conceptual model, engineering methods, elicitation languages, as well as cases studies. It also brings out that the papers most often refer rather evasively to the organizational model layers when aligning and positioning their theory with organizational concepts. Consequently, it sounds useful to orient and improve our own developments in the purpose of ameliorate that issue. Based on that overview's results, we are able to orient our researches more deeply by proposing an innovative approach that focuses in one hand on a policy model designed to take into account the responsibility of stakeholders and in the other hand on policy engineering method that takes care of business process while at the same time using requirement engineering principles. Responsibility is a notion that remains rarely addressed and that however embodies important and well-know concepts like accountability, capability and commitment.

This is achieved in OFE protocols with another property called accountability. It is unfortunate that the accountability has never been formally studied in OFE since its introduction ten years ago.

Putting user data in the direct control of cloud service providers, however, raises security and privacy concerns related to the integrity of outsourced data, the accidental or intentional leakage of sensitive information, the profiling of user activities and so on. Furthermore, even if the cloud provider is trusted, users having access to outsourced files might be malicious and misbehave. These concerns are particularly serious in sensitive applications like personal health records and credit score systems. To tackle this problem, we present GORAM, a cryptographic system that protects the secrecy and integrity of outsourced data with respect to both an untrusted server and malicious clients, guarantees the anonymity and unlink ability of accesses to such data, and allows the data owner to share outsourced data with other clients, selectively granting them read and write permissions. GORAM is the first system to achieve such a wide range of security and privacy properties for outsourced storage. In the process of designing an efficient construction, we developed two new, generally applicable cryptographic schemes, namely, batched zero-knowledge proofs of shuffle and an accountability technique based on chameleon signatures, which we consider of independent interest.

In this paper, we present Progger (Provenance Logger), a kernel-space logger which potentially empowers all cloud stakeholders to trace their data. Logging from the kernel space empowers security analysts to collect provenance from the lowest possible atomic data actions, and enables several higher-level tools to be built for effective end-to-end tracking of data provenance. Within the last few years, there has been an increasing number of proposed kernel space provenance tools but they faced several critical data security and integrity problems. Some of these prior tools' limitations include (1) the inability to provide log tamper-evidence and prevention of fake/manual entries, (2) accurate and granular timestamp synchronisation across several machines, (3) log space requirements and growth, and (4) the efficient logging of root usage of the system. Progger has resolved all these critical issues, and as such, provides high assurance of data security and data activity audit. With this in mind, the paper will discuss these elements of high-assurance cloud data provenance, describe the design of Progger and its efficiency, and present compelling results which paves the way for Progger being a foundation tool used for data activity tracking across all cloud systems.",,978-1-4799-5062-1,,10.1109/CLOUD.2014.121,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6973827,Accountability;Cloud Computing;Data Provenance;Data Security;Tamper-evident logging;Time Synchronisation,Cloud computing;Data security;Kernel;Sockets;Synchronization;Virtual machining,cloud computing;security of data;system monitoring,Progger;cloud computing systems;cloud data provenance tracking;data accountability;data activity audit;data activity tracking;data security component;kernel-space logger,,0,,26,,,June 27 2014-July 2 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Redrawing the security perimeter of a trusted system,"Sterne, D.F.; Benson, G.S.; Tajalli, H.","Trusted Inf. Syst. Inc., Glenwood, MD, USA","Computer Security Foundations Workshop VII, 1994. CSFW 7.

Untrusted subjects, however, can leak sensitive information, undermine the TCB's accountability mechanisms, and destroy information integrity. Hence, the security properties needed by many organizations cannot be enforced at the TCSEC security perimeter, i.e., the TCB interface.

Non-CAS components may also be present on a system bird may be used to manipulate only non-sensitive information. The approach advocates a form of balanced assurance in which the assurance sought for CAS components is commensurate with residual security risks they present.

This inability is due to two main reasons. Firstly, the lack of data tracking tools built for clouds. Secondly, current logging mechanisms are only designed from a system-centric perspective. There is a need for data-centric logging techniques which can trace data activities (e.g. file creation, edition, duplication, transfers, deletions, etc.) within and across all cloud servers. This will effectively enable full transparency and accountability for data movements in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce S2Logger, a data event logging mechanism which captures, analyses and visualizes data events in the cloud from the data point of view. By linking together atomic data events captured at both file and block level, the resulting sequence of data events depicts the cloud data provenance records throughout the data lifecycle. With this information, we can then detect critical data-related cloud security problems such as malicious actions, data leakages and data policy violations by analysing the data provenance.

This is contrary to standard digital signature schemes, which do not permit any modifications by any party without invalidating the signature. Due to transparency, a strong privacy notion, outsiders cannot see if the signature for a message was created by the signer or by the semi-trusted party. Accountability allows the signer to prove to outsiders if a message was original or touched by the semi-trusted party. Currently, block-level accountability requires to drop transparency. We allow for accountability for sanitizable signatures with transparency on the block-level. Additionally, we generalize the concept of block-level properties to groups. This offers a even more fine-grained control and leads to more efficient schemes. We prove that group-level definitions imply both the block-level and message-level notions. We derive a provably secure construction, achieving our enhanced notions. A further modification of our construction achieves efficient group-level non-interactive public accountability. This construction only requires a constant amount of signature generations to achieve this property.

Securing data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to secure the data provenance for these devices by exploiting spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless channel that these devices use for communication. Our solution enables two parties to generate closely matching link fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party can later verify the details of the transaction, particularly the wireless link on which the data was transmitted. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge; they are lightweight compared with traditional provenance mechanisms and enable interesting security properties such as accountability, nonrepudiation, and resist man-in-the-middle attacks. We validate our technique with experiments using bodyworn sensors in scenarios approximating actual device deployment and present some extensions, which reduce energy consumption.

In this work, we present a solution based on declarative design. The core component of our framework is a logic-based declarative API for data processing that exports methods to conveniently specify the system architecture and the intended security properties, and conceals the cryptographic realization. Invisible to the programmer, the implementation of this API relies on a powerful combination of digital signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge, pseudonyms, and reputation lists. We formally proved that the cryptographic implementation enforces the security properties expressed in the declarative specification. The systems produced by our framework enjoy interoperability and open-endedness: they can easily be extended to offer new services and cryptographic data can be shared and processed by different services, without requiring any extra bootstrapping phase or interaction among parties.

Once intuitively confirmed, our work in this article introduces an algorithmic approach to formalizing the semantics of Sequence Diagrams in terms of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) templates. In all the templates, different semantic aspects are expressed as separate, yet simple LTL formulas that can be composed to define the complex semantics of Sequence Diagrams. The formalization enables us to leverage the analytical powers of automated decision procedures for LTL formulas to determine if a collection of Sequence Diagrams is consistent, independent, etc. and also to verify if a system design conforms to the privacy policies.

IEEE International Conference on",20061211,2006,,,509,509,"This paper describes a service-oriented computing kit (SOCK), which is an overarching framework covering the key artifacts in planning, modeling, designing, developing, deploying, and managing service-oriented solutions in the enterprise computing space. Based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, this comprehensive kit is a systematic taxonomy to abstract complexities and organize the major aspects of service-oriented development, so that the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, skillsets, procedures and deliverables can be clearly defined for the IT teams to effectively construct service-oriented systems. SOCK comprises eight modules - architecture, process, integration, environment, technology, development, management, and roadmap. Each module addresses specific technical concerns in particular areas. SOA provides the service definitions, service catalog, service composition, scope of applications and portfolios, and service architecture modeling methodology. SOP deals with the business process management, process modeling and notations, process orchestration, coordination/collaborations, human interactions, and 1-phase commit compensation for long-lived processes. SOI concentrates on the service interoperability, integration patterns, enterprise service bus, traditional synchronous/asynchronous enterprise application integration, and integration with portals and content management systems. SOE consists of the runtime infrastructure, service registry for discovery and directory, service transformation/routing gateway, service virtualization via grid computing, and quality-of-services compliance with service-level agreements. SOT covers the implementation technologies - Web services, standards and specifications, technical patterns, convergence, and aspect-oriented techniques. SOD is composed of the development lifecycle, programming model, design/development tools, frameworks, reusable utilities/toolkits/components, and model-driven approaches. SOM includes ser- - vices & policies repository in service identification and categorization, security mechanisms, business activity monitoring, reporting, BI, and provisioning. SOR handles the planning/blueprint, strategy, KPI dashboards, governance, and organization. The elements in each module are further decomposed to form loose semantic associations.

"The Host Identity Protocol (HIP): Bringing mobility, multi- homing, and baseline security together","Nikander, P.","Ericsson Research, Finland","Security and Privacy in Communications Networks and the Workshops, 2007. SecureComm 2007. Third International Conference on",20080624,2007,,,518,519,"The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is an experimental architecture and protocol, being developed at the IETF since 1999 and reaching its first stable version in 2007. It enhances the original Internet architecture by injecting a new thin layer between the IP layer and the transport protocols. This new layer introduces a new name space consisting of cryptographic identifiers, thereby implementing the so-called identifier / locator split. In the new architecture, the new identifiers are used for naming application level end-points, thereby taking the prior identification role of IP addresses in applications, sockets, TCP connections, and UDP send and receive system calls. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are still used, but only as names for topological locations in the network. At the same time, due to the backwards compatibility mode, no changes are needed in applications. The architectural enhancement implemented by HIP has profound consequences. A number of the previously hard problems become suddenly much easier. Mobility, multi-homing, and baseline end-to-end security integrate neatly into the architecture. The use of cryptographic identifiers allows enhanced accountability, thereby providing a base for easier build up of trust. With some privacy enhancements, HIP allows good location anonymity, assuring strong identity only towards relevant trusted parties. Finally, the HIP protocol has been carefully designed to take middle boxes into account, providing for overlay networks and thereby helping to reduce the currently prevalent problems with bad traffic and routing scalability. This tutorial provides an in-depth look at HIP, discussing its architecture, design, benefits, and potential drawbacks. In the first part of the tutorial, the architecture and design of HIP is discussed in an interactive but lecture-like manner. In the second part of the tutorial the protocol will be demonstrated in practise.

Eleventh IEEE International Workshops on",20021107,2002,,,83,88,"Over the last two decades, many attempts have been made to computerize the management of patient records using advanced computing and networking facilities across healthcare providers such as hospitals, clinics, and clearing agencies. In addition to this transition from a disparate and paper-based infrastructure to a consolidated and digital medium-based one, we have been confronted with privacy and security requirements since the advent of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). The problem we seek to address in this paper is to provide authentication of individual identity in the context of accessing critical information in Web-based e-health systems including secure transmission of data across the Internet. These problems have technical solutions that are well known, but the solutions in general are strongly biased toward a single individual interacting with a single application. In this paper, we propose a scalable token-based authentication architecture and demonstrate how we can implement this architecture using commercial-off-the-set technologies. Our approach focuses on vendor-neutral specifications.

A socio-technical system can be modelled as a series of inter-related, and interacting patterns of behaviour. Within a socio-technical system a security requirements can be derived from the analysis and interaction of the pattern. To capture and understand these requirements/patterns we need to make use of a formal reasoning system that supports a rigorous deductive process. In this paper we will develop a formal model of a socio -- technical systems pattern using a Kripke Semantic model. Then, via the application of Kripke Semantics to the modelling of responsibilities and how they are created/fulfilled within a socio -- context, we will derive a set of security requirements/patterns.",,,,10.1109/SOSE.2014.59,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6830941,Accountability;Liability and Culpabilit;Modal Action Logic (MAL);Responsibility Modelling;SocioTechnical System (STS),Analytical models;Computational modeling;Context;Security;Semantics;Sociotechnical systems,human computer interaction;programming language semantics;security of data;social aspects of automation,Kripke semantic model;deductive process;formal reasoning system;responsibility modelling;security patterns;security requirements;socio-technical system,,0,,18,,,7-11 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Real applications, such as habitat monitoring, environmental and structural monitoring, start to work in practical. In this paper, we argue that wireless sensor network is a very promising technology for fire rescue applications. First, we abstract four specific requirements of this application, including accountability of firefighters, real-time monitoring, intelligent scheduling and resource allocation, and Web-enabled service and integration. To meet these requirements, we propose FireNet, a wireless sensor network architecture for this specific type of application. Based on these requirements and the characteristics of wireless sensor networks, several research challenges in terms of new protocols as well as hardware and software support are examined.

Also of importance is accountability due to safety critical applications. Conditional pseudonymity, i.e., usage of resolvable pseudonyms, is a common approach to address both. Often, resolvability of pseudonyms is achieved by authorities maintaining pseudonym- identity mappings. However, these mappings are privacy sensitive and require strong protection to prevent abuse or leakage. We present a new approach that does not rely on pseudonym-identity mappings to be stored by any party. Resolution information is directly embedded in pseudonyms and can only be accessed when multiple authorities cooperate. Our privacy-preserving pseudonym issuance protocol ensures that pseudonyms contain valid resolution information but prevents issuing authorities from creating pseudonym-identity mappings.",1525-3511,978-1-4244-6396-1,,10.1109/WCNC.2010.5506126,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5506126,,Communications Society;Informatics;Information management;Information security;Joining processes;Privacy;Protection;Public key;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicle driving,ad hoc networks;mobile radio;protocols;telecommunication security,V-tokens;conditional pseudonymity;privacy-preserving pseudonym issuance protocol;pseudonym identity mappings;vehicular ad hoc networks,,5,,15,,,18-21 April 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

The proposed solution comprises the definition and control of Access Rights to the discovery and use of Virtual Objects (VO). This approach builds upon the widely accepted view that Virtual Objects serve as digital representation and gateway to Real World Objects (sensors, actuators, etc), and where VO databases serve to find these virtual counterparts. The Access Rights determine not only who may use a function of a Virtual Object and the conditions for that access, but also determine their discoverability when searching the database of virtual objects counterparts. Access Rights solve important requirements for security, privacy, and accountability, that are prerequisite to the expected economic and innovation benefits of an internet of things across organisational domains.
